A relation of cruel optimism exists when something you desire is actually an
obstacle to your flourishing. It might involve food, or a kind of love; it might
be a fantasy of the good life, or a political project. It might rest on something
simpler, too, like a new habit that promises to induce in you an improved
way of being. These kinds of optimistic relation are not inherently cruel. They
become cruel only when the object that draws your attachment actively impedes the aim that brought you to it initially.
 All attachment is optimistic, if we describe optimism as the force that
moves you out of yourself and into the world in order to bring closer the satisfying
 something that you cannot generate on your own but sense in the wake
of a person, a way of life, an object, project, concept, or scene. But optimism
might not feel optimistic. Because optimism is ambitious, at any moment it
might feel like anything, including nothing: dread, anxiety, hunger, curiosity, the whole gamut from the sly neutrality of browsing the aisles to excitement at the prospect of “the change that’s gonna come.” Or, the change
that is not going to come: one of optimism’s ordinary pleasures is to induce
conventionality, that place where appetites find a shape in the predictable
comforts of the good-life genres that a person or a world has seen fit to
formulate. But optimism doesn’t just manifest an aim to become stupid or
simple—often the risk of attachment taken in its throes manifests an intelligence beyond rational calculation.
 Whatever the experience of optimism is in particular, then, the affective structure of an optimistic attachment involves a sustaining inclination to return
to the scene of fantasy that enables you to expect that this time, nearness to
this thing will help you or a world to become different in just the right way.
But, again, optimism is cruel when the object/scene that ignites a sense of
possibility actually makes it impossible to attain the expansive transformation for which a person or a people risks striving; and, doubly, it is cruel insofar as the very pleasures of being inside a relation have become sustaining
regardless of the content of the relation, such that a person or a world finds
itself bound to a situation of profound threat that is, at the same time, profoundly confirming.
 This book considers relations of cruel optimism ranging from objects or
scenes of romantic love and upward mobility to the desire for the political
itself. At the center of the project, though, is that moral- intimate- economic
thing called “the good life.” Why do people stay attached to conventional
good-life fantasies—say, of enduring reciprocity in couples, families, political systems, institutions, markets, and at work—when the evidence of their
instability, fragility, and dear cost abounds? Fantasy is the means by which
people hoard idealizing theories and tableaux about how they and the world
“add up to something.” What happens when those fantasies start to fray—
depression, dissociation, pragmatism, cynicism, optimism, activism, or an
incoherent mash?
 Readers of my national sentimentality trilogy—The Anatomy of National
Fantasy, The Female Complaint, and The Queen of America Goes to Washington City—
will recognize these questions as central to its investigation of U.S. aesthetics, erotics, and politics over the last two centuries. These works look at
the affective components of citizenship and the public sphere, focusing in
particular on how intimate publics work in proximity to normative modes
of love and the law. Cruel Optimism expands the concerns of that work transnationally and temporally, extending them to the contemporary moment.
The archive of this project, straddling the United States and contemporary
Europe, looks at precarious bodies, subjectivity, and fantasy in terms of citizenship, race, labor, class (dis)location, sexuality, and health. These cases
are linked in relation to the retraction, during the last three decades, of
the social democratic promise of the post–Second World War period in the
United States and Europe.
Cruel Optimism does not cover the entire second half of the twentieth century into the twenty- first, though; nor is it a thorough exposé of the state’s
withdrawal from the uneven expansion of economic opportunity, social
norms, and legal rights that motored so much postwar optimism for democratic access to the good life.1 Instead, taking up mass media, literature,
television, film, and video that appeared between 1990 and the present, it
seeks out the historical sensorium that has developed belatedly since the
fantasmatic part of the optimism about structural transformation realized
less and less traction in the world. The fantasies that are fraying include,
particularly, upward mobility, job security, political and social equality, and
lively, durable intimacy. The set of dissolving assurances also includes meritocracy, the sense that liberal- capitalist society will reliably provide opportunities for individuals to carve out relations of reciprocity that seem fair and
that foster life as a project of adding up to something and constructing cushions for enjoyment. The book is about what happens to fantasies of the good
life when the ordinary becomes a landfill for overwhelming and impending crises of life- building and expectation whose sheer volume so threatens
what it has meant to “have a life” that adjustment seems like an accomplishment. It tracks the emergence of a precarious public sphere, an intimate
public of subjects who circulate scenarios of economic and intimate contingency and trade paradigms for how best to live on, considering.2 Each chapter tells a story about the dissolution of optimistic objects/scenarios that
had once held the space open for the good- life fantasy, and tracks dramas
of adjustment to the transformation of what had seemed foundational into
those binding kinds of optimistic relation we call “cruel.”
 But how can it be said that aesthetically mediated affective responses exemplify a shared historical sense? What follows sketches out the kinds of general conceptual shifts this book seeks to make in casting that question.
 The historical sense with which Cruel Optimism is most concerned involves
conceiving of a contemporary moment from within that moment. One of
this book’s central claims is that the present is perceived, first, affectively:
the present is what makes itself present to us before it becomes anything
else, such as an orchestrated collective event or an epoch on which we can
look back. (Chapter 2, “Intuitionists,” describes this way of thinking about
“the affective present” in Marxist critical theory.) If the present is not at first
an object but a mediated affect, it is also a thing that is sensed and under
constant revision, a temporal genre whose conventions emerge from the
personal and public filtering of the situations and events that are happening
in an extended now whose very parameters (when did “the present” begin?)
are also always there for debate.3
 Discussions about the contours and contents of the shared historical
present are therefore always profoundly political ones, insofar as they are
about what forces should be considered responsible and what crises urgent
in our adjudication of survival strategies and conceptions of a better life
than what the metric of survival can supply. Focus on the present isn’t invariably shallow presentism, or “the narcissism of the now,” therefore—
but even when it is, it involves anxiety about how to assess various knowledges and intuitions about what’s happening and how to eke out a sense of
what follows from those assessments.4 This book pays a lot of attention to
different styles of managing simultaneous, incoherent narratives of what’s
going on and what seems possible and blocked in personal/collective life.
We understand nothing about impasses of the political without having an
account of the production of the present.
 Accordingly, Cruel Optimism has a broad interest in amassing genres of historical duration that mark the unfolding activity of the contemporary moment. This book’s main genre for tracking the sense of the present is the
“impasse.” (See especially chapter 6, “After the Good Life,” for an elaboration of this concept.) Usually an “impasse” designates a time of dithering
from which someone or some situation cannot move forward. In this book’s
adaptation, the impasse is a stretch of time in which one moves around with
a sense that the world is at once intensely present and enigmatic, such that
the activity of living demands both a wandering absorptive awareness and a
hypervigilance that collects material that might help to clarify things, maintain one’s sea legs, and coordinate the standard melodramatic crises with
those processes that have not yet found their genre of event.5 Speaking of
cruel optimism, it may be that, for many now, living in an impasse would 
be an aspiration, as the traditional infrastructures for reproducing life—
at work, in intimacy, politically—are crumbling at a threatening pace. The
holding pattern implied in “impasse” suggests a temporary housing. This
leads us to the other sense of “impasse” that moves throughout the book:
impassivity. Cruel Optimism pays a lot of attention to diverse class, racial,
sexual, and gendered styles of composure. What Jacques Rancière calls “the
distribution of the sensible” appears here not only in the class- based positioning of sensibility, but also in gestural economies that register norms of
self- management that differ according to what kinds of confidence people
have enjoyed about the entitlements of their social location. The way the
body slows down what’s going down helps to clarify the relation of living on
to ongoing crisis and loss.
 In addition to temporal genres of the stretched- out present, the book
develops aesthetic ones for describing the activity of being reflexive about a
contemporary historicity as one lives it. Many genres of the emerging event
appear throughout the book, such as the situation, the episode, the interruption, the aside, the conversation, the travelogue, and the happening. For
example, throughout I define the genre situation in terms of the situation
comedy or the police procedural. The police conventionally say: “We have a
situation here.” A situation is a state of things in which something that will
perhaps matter is unfolding amid the usual activity of life. It is a state of animated and animating suspension that forces itself on consciousness, that
produces a sense of the emergence of something in the present that may become an event. This definition of situation resonates with the concept’s appearance in Alain Badiou’s work with the “event,” but for Badiou the event is
a drama that shocks being into radically open situations—the event constitutes the potential for a scene of ethical sociality.6 (People can’t have fidelity
to a “situation” because they don’t know what it is or how to be in it: and so,
if one follows Badiou’s idiom, the event is that element in the situation that
elaborates the potential good in a radical break, and the antisovereign effect
of the situation that undoes the subject and general sureties threatens ethical action.) Brian Massumi takes a similarly structural but more dialectical
view, attending to the relation of the situation to the event by prioritizing
“event” as that which governs the situation. But Massumi is also quite interested in the sense I value, seeing the situation as a genre of unforeclosed experience.7
 In any case, the situation’s state of animated suspension provides a
way of thinking about some conventions with which we develop a historical
 sense of the present affectively as immanence, emanation, atmosphere,
or emergence. Perturbation is Deleuze’s word for disturbances in the atmosphere that constitute situations whose shape can only be forged by continuous reaction and transversal movement, releasing subjects from the normativity of intuition and making them available for alternative ordinaries.8 The
situation is therefore a genre of social time and practice in which a relation
of persons and worlds is sensed to be changing but the rules for habitation
and the genres of storytelling about it are unstable, in chaos. Chapter 5,
“Nearly Utopian, Nearly Normal,” argues that the precarious public sphere
has generated a new popular variation, the “situation tragedy.” In the situation comedy, the subject whose world is not too destabilized by a “situation”
that arises performs a slapstick maladjustment that turns out absurdly and
laughably, without destroying very much. In the situation tragedy, the subject’s world is fragile beyond repair, one gesture away from losing all access
to sustaining its fantasies: the situation threatens utter, abject unraveling.
In the artwork or in response to other scenes, when an apprehending sensorium senses a potentially significant threat to the ordinary’s ongoing atmosphere, it sparks the rhythms of situation tragedy, with its menacing new
realism.
 Yet while sometimes situations organize into world- shifting events or
threaten the present with their devastating latency, mostly they do not.
How do we learn to process x happening as an emerging event, and how
do the conventional genres of event potentially foreclose the possibility of
the event taking shape otherwise, as genres y and z, which might hover as
possibilities but end up being bracketed and stored somewhere until repetitions call them back, if ever? This kind of attention to the becoming- event
of something involves questions about ideology, normativity, affective adjustment, improvisation, and the conversion of singular to general or exemplary experience. This set of processes—the becoming historical of the
affective event and the improvisation of genre amid pervasive uncertainty—
organizes Cruel Optimism.
 Thus rather than tracking the “waning of affect” as the mark of the
present, I track the waning of genre, and in particular older realist genres (in
which I include melodrama) whose conventions of relating fantasy to ordinary life and whose depictions of the good life now appear to mark archaic
expectations about having and building a life.9 Genres provide an affective expectation of the experience of watching something unfold, whether
that thing is in life or in art. The waning of genre frames different kinds of 
potential openings within and beyond the impasse of adjustment that constant crisis creates. This project draws particularly from Giorgio Agamben’s
analysis of the class- related production of characteristic gestures that the
cinema collects as they become archaic.10 It also emerges from a long engagement with Raymond Williams’s incitement to think about the present
as a process of emergence.11 In the present from which I am writing about
the present, conventions of reciprocity that ground how to live and imagine
life are becoming undone in ways that force the gestures of ordinary improvisation within daily life into a greater explicitness affectively and aesthetically. Cinema and other recording forms not only archive what is being lost
but track what happens in the time that we inhabit before new forms make
it possible to relocate within conventions the fantasy of sovereign life unfolding from actions.
