&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let penalties be regulated and proportioned to the offences, let the 
death sentence be passed only on those convicted of murder, and 
let the tortures that revolt humanity be abolished.’ Thus, in 1789, 
the chancellery summed up the general position of the petitions 
addressed to the authorities concerning tortures and executions (cf. 
Seligman, and Desjardin, 13-20). Protests against the public execu 
tions proliferated in the second half of the eighteenth century: among 
the philosophers and theoreticians of the law; among lawyers and 
parlemeruaires; in popular petitions and among the legislators of the 
assemblies. Another form of punishment was needed: the physical 
confrontation between the sovereign and the condemned man must 
end ; this hand-to-hand fight between the vengeance of the prince and 
the contained anger of the people, through the mediation of the victim 
and the executioner, must be concluded. Very soon the public execu 
tion became intolerable. On the side of power, where it betrayed 
tyranny, excess, the thirst for revenge, and ‘the cruel pleasure taken 
in punishing’ (Petion de Villeneuve, 641), it was revolting. On the 
side of the victim who, though reduced to despair, was still expected 
to bless ‘heaven and its judges who appeared to have abandoned 
him’ (Boucher d’Argis, 1781, 125), it was shameful. It was, in any 
case, dangerous, in that it provided a support for a confrontation 
l>etween the violence of the king and the violence of the people. It 
was as if the sovereign power did not see, in this emulation of 
atrocity, a challenge that it itself threw down and which might one 
day be taken up: accustomed as it was to 'seeing blood flow’, the 
people soon learnt that ‘it could be revenged only with blood’ 
(La:h£re). In these ceremonies, which were the object of so much 
adverse investment, one sees the intersection of the excess of armed 
justice and the anger of the threatened people.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph Mistre 
was to recognize in this relation one of the fundamental mechanisms 
of absolute power: the executioner acts as a cog between the prince 
and the people; the death he deals is like that of the serfs who built 
St Petersburg over swamp and pestilence: it is a principle of uni 
versality; of the individual will of the despot, it makes a law for all, 
and of each of those destroyed bodies, a stone for the State; it hardly 
matters that innocents, too, are struck down! In this same dangerous 
and ritual violence, the eighteenth-century reformers denounced, on 
the contrary, that which exceeded, on both sides, the legitimate 
exercise of power: in this violence, according to them, tyranny 
confronts rebellion; each calls forth the other. It is a double danger. 
Instead of taking revenge, criminal justice should simply punish. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This need for punishment without torture was first formulated 
as a cry from the heart or from an outraged nature. In the worst of 
murderers, there is one thing, at least, to be respected when one 
punishes: his 'humanity'. The day was to come, in the nineteenth 
century, when this 'man', discovered in the criminal, would become 
the target of penal intervention, the object that it claimed to correct 
and transform, the domain of a whole scries of 'criminological' 
sciences and strange 'penitentiary’ practices. But, at the time of the 
Enlightenment, it was not as a theme of positive knowledge that 
man was opposed to the barbarity of the public executions, but as a 
legal limit: the legitimate frontier of the power to punish. Not that 
which must be reached in order to alter him, but that which must 
be left intact in order to respect him. Noli me tangere. It marks the 
end of the sovereign's vengeance. The ‘man’ that the reformers set 
up against the despotism of the scaffold has also become a 'man- 
measure’: not of things, but of power. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, therefore, a problem here: how was this man-measure 
opposed to the traditional practice of punishment? How did he 
become the great moral justification of the reform movement? Why 
this universal horror of torture and such lyrical insistence that 
punishment be 'humane'? Or, which amounts to the same thing, 
how are the two elements, which arc everywhere present in demands 
for a more lenient penal system, 'measure' and 'humanity', to be 
articulated upon one another, in a single strategy? These elements 
are so necessary and yet so uncertain that it is they, as disturbing as 
ever and still associated in the same dubious relation, that one finds 


today whenever the problem of an economy of punishment is posed. 
It is as if the eighteenth century had opened up the crisis of this 
economy and, in order to resolve it, proposed the fundamental law 
that punishment must have 'humanity' as its 'measure', without any 
definitive meaning being given to this principle, which nevertheless 
is regarded as insuperable. We must, therefore, recount the birth 
and early days of this enigmatic 'leniency'. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homage is paid to the ‘great reformers’ - Beccaria, Servan, 
Dupaty, Lacretelle, Duport, Pastoret, Target, Bcrgasse, the com 
pilers of the Colliers, or petitions, and the Constituent Assembly - 
for having imposed this leniency on a legal machinery and on 
'classical' theoreticians who, at the end of the eighteenth century, 
were still rejecting it with well-formulated arguments. (Cf., in par 
ticular, Muyart dc Vouglans’s polemic against Beccaria - Muyart, 
1766.) 

Yet this reform must be situated in a process that historians have I recently uncovered through the study of legal archives: the relaxation of penality in the eighteenth century or, to be more precise, 
the double movement by which, during this period, crimes seemed 
to lose their violence, while punishments, reciprocally, lost some of 
their intensity, but at the cost of greater intervention. From the end 
of the seventeenth century, in fact, one observes a considerable 
diminution in murders and, generally speaking, in physical acts of 
aggression; offences against property seem to take over from crimes 
of violence; theft and swindling, from murder and assault; the 
diffuse, occasional, but frequent delinquency of the poorest classes 
was superseded by a limited, but 'skilled' delinquency; the criminals 
of the seventeenth century were 'harassed men, ill-fed, quick to act, 
quick to anger, seasonal criminals'; those of the eighteenth, 'crafty, 
cunning, sly, calculating'criminals on the fringes of society (Chaunu, 
1961, Z36 and 1966, 107-8). Lastly, the internal organizations of 
delinquency altered; the great gangs of malefactors (looters working 
in small, armed units, groups of smugglers firing on the agents of the 
tax authorities, disbanded soldiers or deserters who roamed the 
countryside together) tended to break up; tracked down more 
efficiently and forced to work in smaller groups - often no more 
than half-a-dozen men - in order to pass undetected, they contented
themselves with more furtive operations, with a more modest 
deployment of forces and less risk of bloodshed: 'The physical 
destruction or institutional dislocation of large gangs ... left the 
field free for an anti-property form of delinquency practised by 
individuals or very small groups of robbers and pickpockets, seldom 
more than four in number' (Le Roy-Ladurie). A general movement 
shifted criminality from the attack of bodies to the more or less 
direct seizure of goods; and from a ‘mass criminality’ to a 'marginal 
criminality’, partly the preserve of professionals. It was as if there 
had been a gradual lowering of level - 'a defusion of the tensions 
that dominate human relations, ... a better control of violent 
impulses' 1 - and as if the illegal practices had themselves slackened 
their hold on the body and turned to other targets. Crime became 
less violent long before punishment became less severe. But this 
transformation cannot be separated from several underlying pro 
cesses. The first of these, as P. Chaunu observes, was a change in 
the operation of economic pressures, a general rise in the standard 
of living, a large demographic expansion, an increase in wealth and 
property and 'a consequent need for security' (Chaunu, 1971, 56). 
Furthermore, throughout the eighteenth century, one can observe a 
certain increased severity in the law: in England, out of the 223 
capital crimes in force at the beginning of the nineteenth century, 
156 had been introduced during the preceding hundred years 
(Buxton, XXXIX); in France, the legislation on vagabondage had 
been revised in the direction of greater severity on several occasions 
since the seventeenth century; a tighter, more meticulous implemen 
tation of the law tended to take account of a mass of minor offences 
that it once allowed to escape more easily: 'in the eighteenth century, 
the law became slower, heavier, harder on theft, whose relative 
frequency had increased, and towards which it now assumed the 
bourgeois appearances of a class justice’;* the growth in France 
above all, and especially in Paris, of a police apparatus that prevented 
the development of organized, open criminality, shifted it towards 
more discreet forms; to this set of precautions, one should add the 
very widespread belief in a constant and dangerous rise in crime. 
Whereas the historians of today observe a diminution in the great 
gangs of malefactors, Le Trosne saw them roaming the French 
countryside like swarms of locusts: 'It is these voracious insects who
daily lay waste the subsistence of the cultivators. They are, quite 
literally, enemy troops spreading over the surface of the territory, 
living as they wish, as in a conquered country, exacting levies under 
the name of alms.' They cost the poorest peasants more than taxes: 
the richer peasants had to pay anything up to a third of their 
incomes (Le Trosne, 1764, 4). Most observers maintained that crime 
was increasing - they included, of course, those who advocated 
sterner measures; they also included those who thought that a law 
that was more restrained in its use of violence would be more 
effective, less liable to retreat before its own consequences (cf., for 
example, Dupaty, 247); and they included the magistrates who 
claimed to be swamped by the number of trials: 'the misery of the 
people and the corruption of morals have increased the number of 
crimes and convicted criminals' (one of the judges of the Chambre 
de la Toumelle in an address to the king, 2 August 1768, quoted 
in Farge, 66); in any case, that crime was on the increase was shown 
by the real practice of the courts. ‘The revolutionary and imperial 
era could already be sensed in the last years of the Ancicn Regime. 
One is struck, in the trials of 1782-9, by the increase in tension. 
There is a new severity towards the poor, a concerted rejection of 

( evidence, a rise in mutual mistrust, hatred and fear' (Chaunu, 19 66, 

to8). 

In fact, the shift from a criminality of blood to a criminality of 
fraud forms part of a whole complex mechanism, embracing the 
development of production, the increase of wealth, a higher juridical 
and moral value placed on property relations, stricter methods of 
surveillance, a tighter partitioning of the population, more efficient 
techniques of locating and obtaining information: the shift in illegal 
practices is correlative with an extension and a refinement of puni 
tive practices. 

Was this a general change of attitude, a 'change that belongs to 
the domain of the spirit and the subconscious' (the expression is 
Mogensen's)? Perhaps, but more certainly and more immediatcl) 
it was an effort to adjust the mechanisms of power that frame tht 
everyday lives of individuals; an adaptation and a refinement of tht 
machinery that assumes responsibility for and places under surveil 
lance their everyday behaviour, their identity, their activity, their 
apparently unimportant gestures; another policy for that multiplicity 
of bodies and forces that constitutes a population. What was emerg 
ing no doubt was not so much a new respect for the humanity of 
the condemned - torture was still frequent in the execution of even 
minor criminals - as a tendency towards a more finely tuned justice, 
towards a closer penal mapping of the social body. Following a 
circular process, the threshold of the passage to violent crimes rises, 
intolerance to economic offences increases, controls become more 
thorough, penal interventions at once more premature and more 
numerous. 

If one compares this process with the critical discourse of the 
reformers, a remarkable strategic coincidence emerges. What they 
were attacking in traditional justice, before they set out the prin 
ciples of a new penality, was certainly the excessive nature of the 
punishments; but an excess that was bound up with an irregularity 
even more than with an abuse of the power to punish. On 24 March 
1790, Thouret opened the debate in the Constituent Assembly on 
the new organization of the judicial power. In his view, this power 
had become 'denatured' in France in three ways. By private appro 
priation: the offices of judge were sold; they were hereditary; they 
had a commercial value and, for that reason, the justice that was 
handed out was onerous. By a confusion between two types of 
power: that which dispenses justice and formulates a sentence by 
applying the law and that which creates the law itself. Lastly, by the 
existence of a whole series of privileges that made the implementa 
tion of the law inconsistent: there were courts, procedures, litigants, 
even offences that were 'privileged' and fell outside common law 
(Archives parlementaires, XII, 344). This was only one of the many 
criticisms that had been levied at the legal system for the past fifty 
years at least, all of which denounced in this denaturation the 
principle of an irregular justice. Penal justice was irregular first of 
all by virtue of the multiplicity of courts responsible for assuring it, 
without ever forming a single and continuous pyramid (cf. Linguet 
or Boucher d'Argis, 1789). Quite apart from the ecclesiastical juris 
dictions, we must take into account the discontinuities, overlappings 
and conflicts between the different legal systems: those of the 
nobility, which still played an important role in judging petty 
offences; those of the king, which were themselves numerous and 
badly coordinated (the sovereign courts were often in conflict with 


the bailiffs' courts and above all with the presidial courts, which had 
recently been created as intermediary instances); those which, dejure 
or de facto, were administered by governmental authorities (such as 
the in tendon ts, or provincial administrators) or police authorities 
(such as the provosts and police magistrates); to these should also 
be added the right possessed by the king or his representatives to 
take decisions on internment or exile quite outside any regular 
procedure. By their very plethora these innumerable authorities 
cancelled each other out and were incapable of covering the social 
body in its entirety. Paradoxically, their overlapping left penal 
justice with innumerable loopholes. This incompleteness was a result 
of differences of custom and procedure, despite the Ordonnance 
Ginerale of 1670; of internal conflicts of responsibility; of private 
interests - political or economic - which each authority found itself 
defending; and, lastly, of the interventions of the royal power, which 
could prevent, by means of pardons, commuted sentences, the evo 
cation of a case before the royal council or direct pressure exerted 
on magistrates, the regular, austere course of justice. 

The criticism of the reformers was directed not so much at the 
weakness or cruelty of those in authority, as at a bad economy of 
power. There was too much power in the lower jurisdictions, which 
could - aided by the ignorance and poverty of those convicted - 
Ignore appeal procedure and carry out arbitrary sentences without 
adequate supervision; there was too much power on the side of the 
prosecution, which possessed almost unlimited means of pursuing 
its investigations, while the accused opposed it virtually unarmed - 
this led judges to be sometimes over-severe and sometimes, by way 
of reaction, too lenient; there was too much power in the hands of 
the judges who were able to content themselves with futile evidence, 
providing it was 'legal' evidence, and who were allowed too great 
a freedom in the choice of penalty; there was too much power in 
the hands of the 'gens du roi or royal magistrates, in relation to the 
accused, but also in relation to other magistrates; lastly, there was 
too much power exercised by the king, who could suspend courts 
of justice, alter their decisions, remove magistrates from office, or 
exile them, and replace them by judges acting under royal com 
mission. The paralysis of justice was due not so much to a weakening 
as to a badly regulated distribution of power, to its concentration 
at a certain number of points and to the conflicts and discontinuities 
that resulted. 

This dysfunction of power was related to a central excess: what 
might be called the monarchical ‘super-power', which identified the 
right to punish with the personal power of the sovereign. This 
theoretical identification made the king the fans justitiae; but the 
practical consequences of this were to be found even in that which 
appeared to oppose him and to limit his absolutism. It was because 
the king, in order to raise money, had appropriated the right to sell 
legal offices, which ‘belonged’ to him, that he was confronted by 
magistrates who owned their offices and who were not only intract 
able, but ignorant, self-interested and frequently compromised. It 
was because he was constantly creating new offices that he multiplied 
the conflicts of power and authority. It was because he exercised too 
close a power over his 'gem' and conferred on them almost dis 
cretionary powers that he intensified the conflicts within the magis- 
trature. It was because he had brought the law into conflict with too 
many summary acts of justice (the jurisdictions of the provosts or 
police magistrates) or with administrative measures, that he para 
lysed normal justice, rendered it sometimes lenient and inconsistent, 
but sometimes over-hasty and severe. 

It was not so much, or not only, the privileges of justice, its 
arbitrariness, its archaic arrogance, its uncontrolled rights that were 
criticized; but rather the mixture of its weaknesses and excesses, its 
exaggerations and its loopholes, and above all the very principle of 
this mixture, the ‘super-power' of the monarch. The true objective 
of the reform movement, even in its most general formulations, was 
not so much to establish a new right to punish based on more 
equitable principles, as to set up a new 'economy' of the power to 
punish, to assure its better distribution, so that it should be neither 
too concentrated at certain privileged points, nor too divided be 
tween opposing authorities; so that it should be distributed in 
homogeneous circuits capable of operating everywhere, in a con 
tinuous way, down to the finest grain of the social body . 4 The 
reform of criminal law must be read as a strategy for the rearrange 
ment of the power to punish, according to modalities that render 
it more regular, more effective, more constant and more detailed in 
its effects; in short, which increase its effects while diminishing its
economic cost (that is to say, by dissociating it from the system of 
property, of buying and selling, of corruption in obtaining not only 
offices, but the decisions themselves) and its political cost (by dis 
sociating it from the arbitrariness of monarchical power). The new 
juridical theory of penality corresponds in fact to a new ‘political 
economy’ of the power to punish. This explains why the ’reform’ 
did not have a single origin. It was not the more enlightened mem 
bers of the public, nor the philosophcs , who regarded themselves as 
enemies of despotism and friends of mankind; it was not even the 
social groups opposed to the parlementaires who instigated the 
reform. Or rather it was not they alone; in this same overall project 
of a new distribution of the power to punish, and of a new distribu 
tion of its effects, many different interests came together. The reform 
was not prepared outside the legal machinery and against all its 
representatives; it was prepared, for the most part, from within, by 
a large number of magistrates and on the basis of shared objectives 
and the power conflicts that divided them. Certainly the reformers 
did not form a majority of the magistrates; but it was a body of 
lawyers who outlined its general principles: a power to judge that 
would not be affected by the immediate exercise of the prince's 
sovereignty; that would be relieved of any claim to legislate; that 
would be detached from property relations; and which, having no 
other functions but to judge, would exercise that power to the full. 
In short, the power to judge should no longer depend on the 
innumerable, discontinuous, sometimes contradictory privileges of 
sovereignty, but on the continuously distributed effects of public 
power. This general principle defined an overall strategy that 
covered many different struggles. Those of philosophers like 
Voltaire and of publicists like Brissot or Marat; but also those of 
magistrates whose interests were nevertheless very diverse: Le 
Trosne, a judge at the presidial court of Orleans, and Lacretelle, the 
advocate-general at the parlement; Target, who with the parlements 
was opposed to Maupeou’s reform; but also J. N. Moreau, w'ho 
supported the royal power against the parlementaires; Servan and 
Dupaty, both magistrates, but in conflict with their colleagues, etc. 

Throughout the eighteenth century, inside and outside the legal 
apparatus, in both everyday penal practice and the criticism of 
institutions, one secs the emergence of a new strategy for the 
exercise of the power to punish. And 'reform’, in the strict sense, as 
it was formulated in the theories of law or as it was outlined in the 
various projects, was the political or philosophical resumption of 
this strategy, with its primary objectives: to make of the punishment 
and repression of illegalities a regular function, coextensive with 
society; not to punish less, but to punish better; to punish with an 
attenuated severity perhaps, but in order to punish with more 
universality and necessity; to insert the power to punish more deeply 
into the social body. 

The conjuncture that saw the birth of reform is not, therefore, 
that of a new sensibility, but that of another policy with regard to 
illegalities. 

Roughly speaking, one might say that, under the Ancien Regime 
each of the different social strata had its margin of tolerated illega 
lity: the non-application of the rule, the non-observance of the 
innumerable edicts or ordinances were a condition of the political 
and economic functioning of society. This feature may not have 
been peculiar to the Ancien Regime. But illegality was so deeply 
rooted and so necessary to the life of each social stratum, that it had 
in a sense its own coherence and economy. Sometimes it took on an 
absolutely statutory form - as with the privileges accorded certain 
individuals and groups - which made it not so much an illegality 
as a regular exemption. Sometimes it took the form of a massive 
general non-observance, which meant that for decades, sometimes 
for centuries, ordinances could be published and constantly renewed 
without ever being implemented. Sometimes it was a matter of laws 
gradually falling into abeyance, then suddenly being reactivated; 
sometimes of silent consent on the part of the authorities, neglect, or 
quite simply the actual impossibility of imposing the law and appre 
hending offenders. The least-favoured strata of the population did 
not have, in principle, any privileges: but they benefited, within the 
margins of what was imposed on them by law and custom, from a 
space of tolerance, gained by force or obstinacy; and this space was 
for them so indispensable a condition of existence that they were 
often ready to rise up to defend it; the attempts that were made 
periodically to reduce it, by reviving old laws or by improving the 
methods of apprehending, provoked popular disturbances, just as 


attempts to reduce certain privileges disturbed the nobility, the 
clergy and the bourgeoisie. 

This necessary illegality, of which every social stratum bore 
within itself specific forms, was caught up in a series of paradoxes. 
In its lower regions, it was identified with criminality, from which 
it was difficult to distinguish it juridically, if not morally: from fiscal 
illegality to customs illegality, to smuggling, to looting, to the 
armed struggle against the government’s taxation agents, then 
against the soldiers themselves and, finally, to rebellion, there was 
a continuity, in which it was difficult to mark the frontiers; or, again, 
vagabondage (severely punished according to the terms of ordin 
ances that were never implemented) with the pillage, aggravated 
theft, even murder that went with it, provided a welcome environ 
ment to the unemployed, to workers who had left their employers 

Fi in irregular circumstances, to domestic servants who had some 
reason to flee their masters, to ill-treated apprentices, to deserting 
soldiers, to all those who wished to escape the press-gang. So 
criminality merged into a wider illegality, to which the lower strata 
were attached as to conditions of existence; and, conversely, this 
illegality was a perpetual factor in the increase of crime. Hence an 
ambiguity in popular attitudes: on the one hand, the criminal - 
especially when he happened to be a smuggler or a peasant who had 
fled from the exactions of a master - benefited from a spontaneous 
wave of sympathy: his acts of violence were seen as descending 
directly from old struggles. On the other hand, a man who, under 
cover of an illegality accepted by the population, committed crimes 
at the expense of this population, the vagrant beggar, for example, 
who robbed and murdered, easily became the object of a special hate: 
he had redirected upon the least favoured illegality that was integral 
to their conditions of existence. Thus there grew up around crimes 
a network of glorification and blame; effective help and fear alter 
nated with regard to this shifting population, which one knew was 
very near, but from which one felt that crime could emerge. 
Popular illegality enveloped a whole nucleus of criminality that was 
both its extreme form and its internal danger. 

Between this illegality of the depths and those of the other social 
castes, there was neither an exact convergence nor a profound opposi 
tion. Generally speaking, the different illegalities proper to each
group maintained relations with one another that involved not only 
rivalry, competition and conflicts of interest, but also mutual help 
and complicity: the peasants’ refusal to pay certain state or eccle 
siastical rents was not necessarily disapproved of by the landowners; 
the non-application by artisans of manufacturing regulations was 
often encouraged by the new entrepreneurs; smuggling - the story 
of Mandrin, welcomed by the entire population, received in castles 
and protected by parlemcniaircs proves this - was very widely 
supported. At most, one had seen in the seventeenth century the 
different fiscal refusals coalesce in serious revolts among widely 
separated social strata. In short, the reciprocal interplay of illegali 
ties formed part of the political and economic life of society. Or 
rather, a number of transformations (the abeyance into which 
Colbert’s regulations had fallen, for example, the non-observance 
of customs barriers within the kingdom, the breakdown of guild 
practices) had operated in the breach that was being widened every 
day by popular illegality; the bourgeoisie had needed these trans 
formations; and economic growth was due, in part, to them. 
Tolerance then became encouragement. 

In the second half of the eighteenth century, the process tended to 
be reversed. First, with the general increase in wealth, but also with 
the sudden demographic expansion, the principal target of popular 
illegality tended to be not so much rights, as goods: pilfering 
and theft tended to replace smuggling and the armed struggle 
against the tax agents. And, in this respect, the peasants, farmers 
and artisans were often its principal victims. Lc Trosne was no 
doubt exaggerating a real tendency when he described the peasants’ 
suffering under the exactions of vagabonds, even more than they 
had suffered under feudal demands: thieves now attacked them like 
a cloud of maleficent insects, devouring crops and depleting the 
granaries (Lc Trosne, 1764, 4). It might be said that gradually in 
the eighteenth century* a crisis of popular illegality had occurred; 
and neither the movements at the beginning of the Revolution 
(around the refusal of seigniorial rights), nor those later movements, 
in which the struggle against property rights, political and religious 
protests and the refusal of conscription came together, recombined 
illegality in its old, welcoming form. Furthermore, although a large 
part of the bourgeoisie had accepted, without too much trouble, 


the illegality of rights, it found it difficult to support illegality when 
it was a question of its own property rights. Nothing could be more 
typical of this than the problem of peasant delinquency at the end 
of the eighteenth century and especially after the Revolution 
(Berce, 161). The transition to an intensive agriculture exercised, 
over the rights to use common lands, over various tolerated prac 
tices, over small accepted illegalities, a more and more restrictive 
pressure. Furthermore, as it was acquired in part by the bourgeoisie, 
now free of the feudal burdens that once weighed upon it, landed 
property became absolute property: all the tolerated ‘rights’ that 
the peasantry had acquired or preserved (the abandonment of old 
obligations or the consolidation of irregular practices: the right of 
free pasture, wood-collecting, etc.) were now rejected by the new 
owners who regarded them quite simply as theft (thus leading, 
among the people, to a series of chain reactions of an increasingly 
illegal, or, if one prefers the term, criminal kind: breaches of close, 
the theft or killing of cattle, fires, assaults, murders (cf. Festy 
and Agulhon). The illegality of rights, which often meant 
the survival of the most deprived, tended, with the new status of 
property, to become an illegality of property. It then had to be 
punished. 

And this illegality, while resented by the bourgeoisie where the 
ownership of land was concerned, was intolerable in commercial and 
industrial ownership: the development of the ports, the appearance 
of great warehouses in which merchandise w-as stored, the organiza 
tion of huge workshops (with considerable quantities of raw 
materials, tools and manufactured articles, which belonged to the 
entrepreneurs and which were difficult to supervise) also necessitated 
a severe repression of illegality. The way in which wealth tended to 
be invested, on a much larger scale than ever before, in commodities 
and machines presupposed a systematic, armed intolerance of 
illegality. The phenomenon was obviously very evident where 
economic development was most intense. Colquhoun set out to 
give proof, supported by figures, of the urgent need to check the 
innumerable illegal practices that had grown up: according to the 
estimates of the entrepreneurs and insurance companies, the theft 
of produce imported from America and warehoused along the banks 
of the Thames had risen, on average, to £250,000 per annum; in
all, approximately £500,000 worth of goods was stolen each year 
in the Port of London itself (and this did not include the arsenals 
and warehouses outside the port proper); to this should be added 
£700,000 for the town itself. In this situation of permanent pilfering, 
three phenomena, says Colquhoun, should be taken into considera 
tion: first, the complicity and often the active participation of the 
clerks, overseers, foremen and workers: ‘Whenever a large number 
of workers are gathered together in one place, there arc bound to be 
a lot of bad characters among them’; second, the existence of a whole 
organization of illicit commerce, which began in the workshops or 
docks, then passed on to the receivers - wholesale receivers, 
specializing in certain kinds of commodity, and retail receivers 
whose stalls offered a ‘wretched display of old iron, rags and worn 
clothes, whereas at the back of the shop were hidden naval munitions 
of great value, copper bolts and nails, pieces of cast iron and precious 
metals, produce from the West Indies, furniture and all kinds of 
goods bought from the labourers’ - then on to dealers and pedlars 
who distributed the stolen goods far into the countryside (Colqu 
houn, 1797; in chapters VII, VIII and XV, he gives a very detailed 
account of this process); third, counterfeiting (it seems that there 
were between forty and fifty mints producing counterfeit money 
throughout England, in permanent operation). But what facilitated 
the work of this huge undertaking, involving both depredation and 
competition, was a whole set of tolerances: some amounted almost 
to acquired right (the right, for example, to collect bits of iron or 
rope around ships or to resell the sugar sweepings); others were of 
the nature of a moral acceptance; the pilferers themselves regarded 
their work as a kind of smuggling, which 'they did not regard as a 
serious offence’. 

It proved necessary, therefore, to control these illicit practices 
and introduce new legislation to cover them. The offences had to be 
properly defined and more surely punished; out of this mass of 
irregularities, sometimes tolerated and sometimes punished with a 
severity out of all proportion to the offence, one had to determine 
what was an intolerable offence, and the offenders had to be appre 
hended and punished. With the new forms of capital accumulation, 
new relations of production and the new legal status of property, 
all the popular practices that belonged, either in a silent, everyday, 


tolerated form, or in a violent form, to the illegality of rights were 
reduced by force to an illegality of property. In that movement 
which transformed a society of juridico-political levies into a society 
of the appropriation of the means and products of labour, theft 
tended to become the first of the great loopholes in legality. Or, to 
put it another way, the economy of illegalities was restructured 
with the development of capitalist society. The illegality of property 
was separated from the illegality of rights. This distinction repre- 
%ents a class opposition because, on the one hand, the illegality 
that was to be most accessible to the lower classes was that of 


property - the violent transfer of ownership - and because, on the 
other, the bourgeoisie was to reserve to itself the illegality of rights: 
the possibility of getting round its own regulations and its own laws, 
of ensuring for itself an immense sector of economic circulation by 
a skilful manipulation of gaps in the law - gaps that were foreseen 
by its silences, or opened up by Je facto tolerance. And this great 
redistribution of illegalities was even to be expressed through a 
specialization of the legal circuits: for illegalities of property - for 
theft - there were the ordinary courts and punishments; for the 
illegalities of rights - fraud, tax evasion, irregular commercial 
operations - special legal institutions applied with transactions, 
imodations, reduced fines, etc. 'Hie bourgeoisie reserved to 
itself the fruitful domain of the illegality of rights. And at the same 
lime as this split was taking place, there emerged the need for 
.1 constant policing concerned essentially with this illegality of 
property. It became necessary to get rid of the old economy of the 
power to punish, based on the principles of the confused and in 
adequate multiplicity of authorities, the distribution and concentra 
tion of the power correlative with actual inertia and inevitable 
tolerance, punishments that were spectacular in their manifestations 
and haphazard in their application. It became necessary to define a 
strategy and techniques of punishment in which an economy of 
continuity and permanence would replace that of expenditure and 
rxcess. In short, penal reform was born at the point of junction 
Ixrtween the struggle against the super-power of the sovereign and 
that against the infra-power of acquired and tolerated illegalities. 
And if penal reform was anything more than the temporary result 
of a purely circumstantial encounter, it was because, between this

super-power and this infra-power, a whole network of relations 
was being formed. By placing on the side of the sovereign the 
additional burden of a spectacular, unlimited, personal, irregular 
and discontinuous power, the form of monarchical sovereignty left 
the subjects free to practise a constant illegality; this illegality was 
like the correlative of this type of power. So much so that in attack 
ing the various prerogatives of the sovereign one was also attacking 
the functioning of the illegalities. The two objectives were in con 
tinuity. And, according to particular circumstances or tactics, the 
reformers laid more stress on one or the other. Le Trosne, the 
physiocrat who was a judge at the presidial court of Orleans, may 
serve as an example. In 1764, he published a memorandum on vaga 
bondage: that hot-bed of thieves and murderers 'who live in the 
midst of society without being members of it', who wage 'a veritable 
war on all citizens’, and who are in the midst of us ‘in that state that 
one supposes existed before the establishment of civil society'. 
Against them, he demanded the most severe penalties (character 
istically, he expressed surprise that one should be more indulgent 
towards them than to smugglers); he wanted the police to be rein 
forced, the mounted constabulary to hunt them down with the help 
of the population that suffered from their depredations; he demanded 
that these useless and dangerous people should be 'acquired by the 
state and that they should belong to it as slaves to their masters'; 
and if necessary one should organize collective round-ups in the 
woods to drive them out, and anyone making a capture should be 
paid: ‘A reward of ten pounds is given for anyone who kills a wolf. 
A vagabond is infinitely more dangerous for society' (Le Trosne, 
1764, 8, 50, 54, 61-a). In 1777 in Vues sur la justice criminelle , the 
same Le Trosne demanded that the prerogatives of the Crown be 
reduced, that the accused be regarded as innocent until proved 
guilty, that the judge be a just arbiter between them and society, 
that laws be ‘fixed, constant, determined in the most precise way', 
so that subjects know 'to what they are exposed' and that magis 
trates be nothing more than the 'organ of the law' (Lc Trosne, 1777, 
31, 37i 103-6). For Le Trosne, as for so many others at that time, 
the struggle for the delimitation of the power to punish was articu 
lated directly on the need to subject popular illegality to a stricter 
and more constant control. It is understandable that the criticism 
of the public execution should have assumed such importance in 
penal reform: for it was the form in which, in the most visible way, 
the unlimited power of the sovereign and the ever-active illegality 
of the people came together. Humanity in the sentences was the 
rule given to a system of punishment that must fix their limits on 
both. The 'man' that must be respected in the sentence was the 
juridical and moral form given to this double delimitation. 

But, although it is true that reform, as a penal theory and as a 
strategy of the power to punish, took shape at the point of coinci 
dence of these two objectives, its stability in the future was due to 
the fact that, for a long time, priority was given to the second. It was 
because the pressure on popular illegalities had become, at the period 

I of the Revolution, then under the Empire, and finally throughout 
the n.neteenth century, an essential imperative, that reform was able 
to pass from the project stage to that of an institution and set of 
practices. That is to say, although the new criminal legislation 
appears to be characterized by less severe penalties, a clearer codi 
fication, a marked diminution of the arbitrary, a more generally 
accepted consensus concerning the power to punish (in the absence 
of a more real division in its exercise), it is sustained in reality by an 
upheaval in the traditional economy of illegalities and a rigorous 
application of force to maintain their new adjustment. A penal sys 
tem must be conceived as a mechanism intended to administer 
illegalities differentially, not to eliminate them all. 

Shift the object and change the scale. Define new tactics in order 
to reach a target that is now more subtle but also more widely spread 
in the social body. Find new techniques for adjusting punishment to 
it and for adapting its effects. Lay down new principles for regulariz 
ing, refining, universalizing the art of punishing. Homogenize its 
application. Reduce its economic and political cost by increasing its 
effectiveness and by multiplying its circuits. In short, constitute a 
new economy and a new technology of the power to punish: these 
are no doubt the essential raisons d’etre of penal reform in the 
eighteenth century. 

At the level of principles, this new strategy falls easily into the 
general theory of the contract. The citizen is presumed to have 
accepted once and for all, with the laws of society, the very law by 
which he may be punished. Thus the criminal appears as a juridically 
paradoxical being. He has broken the pact, he is therefore the enemy 
of society as a whole, but he participates in the punishment that is 
practised upon him. The least crime attacks the whole of society; 
and the whole of society - including the criminal - is present in the 
least punishment. Penal punishment is therefore a generalized 
function, coextensive with the function of the social body and with 
each of its elements. This gives rise to the problem of the degree of 
punishment, the economy of the power to punish. 

In effect the offence opposes an individual to the entire social 
body; in order to punish him, society has the right to oppose him 
in its entirety. It is an unequal struggle: on one side are all the forces, 
all the power, all the rights. And this is how it should be, since the 
defence of each individual is involved. Thus a formidable right to 
punish is established, since the offender becomes the common 
enemy. Indeed, he is worse than an enemy, for it is from within 
society that he delivers his blows - he is nothing less than a traitor, 
a 'monster'. How could society not have an absolute right over him? 
How could it not demand, quite simply, his elimination? And, 
although it is true that the principle of punishment must be sub 
scribed to in the pact, must not each citizen, logically, accept the 
extreme penalty for those of them who attack them as a body. 
'Every malefactor, by attacking the social rights, becomes, by his 
crimes, a rebel and a traitor to his country; by violating its laws he 
ceases to be a member of it; he even makes war upon it. In such a 
case the preservation of the state is inconsistent with his own, and 
one or the other must perish; in putting the guilty to death we slay 
not so much the citizen as the enemy.' 5 The right to punish has been 
shifted from the vengeance of the sovereign to the defence of 
society. But it now finds itself recombined with elements so strong 
that it becomes almost more to be feared. The malefactor has been 
saved from a threat that is by its very nature excessive, but he is 
exposed to a penalty that seems to be without bounds. It is a return 
to a terrible 'super-power'. It brings with it the need to establish a 
principle of moderation for the power of punishment. 

‘Who does not shudder with horror when reading in history of so 
many terrible and useless torments, invented and coldly applied by 
monsters who took upon themselves the name of sage?' (Beccaria, 


87). Or again: ‘The laws summon me to the greatest punishment 
of crimes. I go with all the fury that it has inspired in me. But 
what is this? They even go beyond it. . . God, who has imprinted 
in our hearts an aversion to pain for ourselves and for our fellow 
men, are they then those same beings, whom thou hast created so 
weak and so sensible, who have invented such barbarous, such 
refined tortures?' (Lacretclle, 129). The principle of moderation in 
punishment, even when it is a question of punishing the enemy of 
the social body, is articulated first as a discourse of the heart. Or 
rather, it leaps forth like a cry from the body, which is revolted at 
the sight or at the imagination of too much cruelty. The formulation 
of the principle that penality must remain 'humane' is expressed by 
the reformers in the first person. It is as if the sensibility of the 
speaker were being expressed directly; as if the body of the philoso 
pher or theoretician had come, between executioner and victim, to 
affirm his own law and to impose it finally on the entire economy 
of punishment. Does this lyricism express an inability to find a 
raticnal foundation for a penal arithmetic? Between the contractual 
principle that expels the criminal from society and the image of the 
monster 'vomited' by nature, where is one to find a limit, if not in a 
human nature that is manifested - not in the rigour of the law, 
not in the ferocity of the delinquent - but in the sensibility 
of the reasonable man who makes the law and does not commit 
crime? 

But this recourse to 'sensibility' does not exactly express a 
theoretical impossibility. In fact, it bears within it a principle of 
calculation. The body, the imagination, pain, the heart to be re 
spected are not, in effect, those of the criminal that is to be punished, 
but those of the men who, having subscribed to the pact, have the 
right of exercising against him the power of assembly. The pain that 
must exclude any reduction in punishment is that felt by the judges 
or spectators with all the hardness of heart that it may bring with it, 
all the ferocity induced by familiarity, or on the contrary, ill- 
founded feelings of pity and indulgence: ‘Thank God for those 
gentle, sensitive souls on whom those horrible executions exert a 
kind of torture' (Lacretelle, 131). What has to be arranged and 
calculated are the return effects of punishment on the punishing 
authority and the power that it claims to exercise.
Here the principle takes root that one should never apply ‘in 
humane' punishments to a criminal, who, nevertheless, may well be 
a traitor and a monster. If the law must now treat in a 'humane' way 
an individual who is 'outside nature' (whereas the old justice treated 
the 'outlaw' inhumanely), it is not on account of some profound 
humanity that the criminal conceals within him, but because of a 
necessary regulation of the effects of power. It is this 'economic' 
rationality that must calculate the penalty and prescribe the appro 
priate techniques. 'Humanity' is the respectable name given to this 
economy and to its meticulous calculations. 'Where punishment is 
concerned, the minimum is ordered by humanity and counselled by 
policy.’ a 

So, in order to understand this techno-politics of punishment, let 
us take the extreme case, the ultimate crime: a deed of such enormity 
that it violates all the most respected laws. It is produced in circum 
stances so extraordinary, in such profound secrecy, with such lack 
of restraint, as if at the very limit of possibility, that it could not 
be other than unique, in any case the last of its kind: no one could 
ever imitate it; no one could take it as an example, or even feel 
scandalized that it should have been committed. It is doomed to 
disappear without trace. This fable 7 of the 'ultimate crime’ is, to the 
new penality, what original sin was to the old: the pure form in 
which the reason for punishment appears. 

Ought such a crime to be punished? According to what calcula 
tion? Of what use could its punishment be in the economy of the 
power to punish? It would be useful to the extent that it could make 
reparation for 'the harm done to society’ (Pastoret, II, at). Now, 
if one sets aside the strictly material damage - which even when it is 
irreparable as in the case of a murder is of little account in relation 
to society as a whole - the injury that a crime inflicts upon the 
social body is the disorder that it introduces into it: the scandal that 
it gives rise to, the example that it gives, the incitement to repeat it 
if it is not punished, the possibility of becoming widespread that it 
bears within it. In order to be useful, punishment must have as its 
objective the consequences of the crime, that is to say, the series of 
disorders that it is capable of initiating: 'The proportion between 
the penalty and the quality of the offence is determined by the 
influence that the violation of the pact has on the social order’ 


(Filangieri, 214). But this influence of a crime is not necessarily in 
direct proportion to its horror; a crime that horrifies the conscience 
is often of less effect than an offence that everyone tolerates and feels 
quite ready to imitate. There is a scarcity of great crimes; on the 
other hand, there is the danger that everyday offences may multiply. 
So one must not seek a qualitative relation between the crime and 
its punishment, an equivalence of horror: 'Can the cries of a wretch 
in torment bring back from the depths of a past that cannot return 
an action that has already been committed?' (Beccaria, 87). One 
must calculate a penalty in terms not of the crime, but of its possible 
repetition. One must take into account not the past offence, but the 
future disorder. Things must be so arranged that the malefactor can 
have neither any desire to repeat his offence, nor any possibility of 
having imitators.* Punishment, then, will be an art of effects; rather 
than opposing the enormity of the penalty to the enormity of the 
crime, one must adjust to one another the two series that follow 
from the crime: its own effects and those of the penalty. A crime 
without a dynasty does not call for punishment; any more than, 
according to another version of the same fable, a society on the 
verge of dissolution and disappearance would have the right to erect 
scaffolds. The last crime cannot but remain unpunished. 

This was an old view. The function of punishment as example 
was to be found long before the eighteenth-century reform. That 
punishment looks towards the future, and that at least one of its 
major functions is to prevent crime had, for centuries, been one of 
the current justifications of the right to punish. But the difference 
was that the prevention that was expected as an effect of the punish 
ment and its spectacle - and therefore of its excess - tended now to 
become the principle of its economy and the measure of its just 
proportions. One must punish exactly enough to prevent repetition. 
There is, then, a shift in the mechanics of example: in a penality 
employing public torture and execution, example was the answer 
to the crime; it had, by a sort of twin manifestation, to show the 
crime and at the same time to show the sovereign power that 
mastered it; in a penality calculated according to its own effects, 
example must refer back to the crime, but in the most discreet w-ay 
possible and with the greatest possible economy indicate the inter 
vention of pbwer; ideally, too, it should prevent any subsequent 
reappearance of either. The example is no longer a ritual that mani 
fests; it is a sign that serves as an obstacle. Through this technique of 
punitive signs, which tends to reverse the whole temporal field of 
penal action, the reformers thought they were giving to the power 
to punish an economic, effective instrument that could be made 
general throughout the entire social body, capable of coding all its 
behaviour and consequently of reducing the whole diffuse domain 
of illegalities. The semio-technique with which one tried to arm the 
power to punish rested on five or six major rules. 

The rule of minimum quantity. A crime is committed because it 
procures certain advantages. If one linked, to the idea of crime, the 
idea of a slightly greater disadvantage, it would cease to be desir 
able. ‘For punishment to produce the effect that must be expected of 
it, it is enough that the harm that it causes exceed the good that the 
criminal has derived from the crime’ (Bcccaria, 89). A proximity 
between penalty and crime can, indeed must, be accepted; but no 
longer in its old form, where the public execution had to be equi 
valent in intensity to the crime, with an additional factor that 
marked the ‘surplus power’ of the sovereign carrying out his legiti 
mate vengeance; it is a quasi-equivalence at the level of interests: a 
little more interest in avoiding the penalty than in risking the crime. 

The rule of sufficient ideality. If the motive of a crime is the 
advantage expected of it, the effectiveness of the penalty is the dis 
advantage expected of it. This means that the ’pain' at the heart of 
punishment is not the actual sensation of pain, but the idea of pain, 
displeasure, inconvenience - the ‘pain’ of the idea of’pain’. Punish 
ment has to make use not of the body, but of representation. Or 
rather, if it does make use of the body, it is not so much as the sub 
ject of a pain as the object of a representation: the memory of pain 
must prevent a repetition of the crime, just as the spectacle, how 
ever artificial it may be, of a physical punishment may prevent the 
contagion of a crime. But it is not pain in itself that will be the 
instrument of the technique of punishment. Therefore, as long as 
possible, and except in cases requiring an effective representation, 
one should avoid recourse to the great panoply of the scaffold. 
There is an elision of the body as the subject of the punishment, but 
not necessarily as an clement in a spectacle. The rejection of the 
public execution which, at the threshold of the theory, had found 


no more than a lyrical expression, was now offered the possibility 
of a rational articulation: what must be maximized is the representa 
tion of the penalty, not its corporal reality. 

The rule of lateral effects. The penalty must have its most intense 
effects on those who have not committed the crime; to carry the 
argument to its limit, if one could be sure that the criminal could not 
repeat the crime, it would be enough to make others believe that he 
had been punished. There is a centrifugal intensification of effects, 
which leads to the paradox that in the calculation of penalties the 
least important element is still the criminal (unless he is likely to 
repeat the offence). Beccaria illustrated this paradox in the punish 
ment that he proposed to replace the death sentence - perpetual 
slavery. Is this not a physically more cruel punishment than death? 
Not at all, he says: because the pain of slavery, for the condemned 
man, is divided into as many portions as he has moments left to live; 
it is an infinitely divisible penalty, an Eleatic penalty, much less 
severe than capital punishment, which is only one step away from 
the public execution. On the other hand, for those who sec these 
slaves, or represent them to themselves, the pains they bear are 
concentrated into a single idea; all the moments of slavery are 
contracted into a representation that then becomes more terrifying 
than the idea of death. It is the economically ideal punishment: it 
is minimal for him who undergoes it (and who, reduced to slavery, 
cannot repeat his crime) and it is maximal for him who represents it 
to himself. ‘Among the penalties, and in the way of applying them 
in proportion to the offences, one must choose the means that will 
leave the most lasting impression on the minds of the people, and 
the least cruel on the body of the criminal' (Beccaria, 87). 

The rule of perfect certainty. With the idea of each crime and the 
advantages to be expected of it must be associated the idea of a 
particular punishment with the precise inconveniences that result 
from it; the link from one to the other must be regarded as necessary 
and unbreakable. This general element of certainty that must give 
the system of punishment its effectiveness involves a number of 
precise measures. The laws that define the crime and lay down the 
penalties must be perfectly clear, ‘so that each member of society 
may distinguish criminal actions from virtuous actions’ (Brissot, 
24). These laws must be published, so that everyone has access to 
them; what is needed is not oral traditions and customs, but a written 
legislation which can be 'the stable monument of the social pact', 
printed texts available to all: 'Only printing can make the public as 
a whole and not just a lew persons depositories of the sacred code of 
the laws’ (Beccaria, 26). The monarch must renounce his right of 
pardon so that the force that is present in the idea of punishment 
is not attenuated by the hope of intervention: ‘If one allows men to 
see that the crime may be pardoned and that punishment is not a 
necessary consequence of it, one nourishes in them the hope of 
going unpunished. . . The laws must be inexorable, those who 
execute them inflexible.’ 9 Above all, no crime committed must 
escape the gaze of those whose task it is to dispense justice. Nothing 
so weakens the machinery of the law than the hope of going un 
punished; how could one establish in the minds of the public a strict 
link between the offence and a penalty if it were affected by a certain 
coefficient of improbability? Would it not be necessary to make the 
penalty the more to be feared in its violence as it is less to be feared 
in its uncertainty? Rather than imitate the old system in this way 
and be 'more severe, one must be more vigilant’. 10 Hence the idea 
that the machinery of justice must be duplicated by an organ of 
surveillance that would work side by side with it, and which would 
make it possible either to prevent crimes, or, if committed, to arrest 
their authors; police and justice must work together as tw-o comple 
mentary actions of the same process - the police assuring 'the action 
of society on each individual’, justice ’the rights of individuals 
against society' (Duport, Archives parlementaires, XXI, 45). Thus 
every crime will come to the light of day and be punished in all 
certainty. But it is also necessary that the legal procedures should 
not remain secret, that the reasons why a defendant is condemned or 
acquitted should be know n to all, and each individual must be able 
to recognize the reasons for a penalty: ‘Let the magistrate speak his 
opinion aloud, let him be obliged to read in his judgement the text 
of the law that condemns the defendant. . . Let the procedures that 
are buried mysteriously in the obscurity of the records office be 
opened to all citizens who arc concerned at the fate of the con 
demned’ (Mably, 348). 

The rule ofcommon truth. Beneath this ordinary-seeming principle 
is hidden an important transformation. The old system of legal 


proofs, the use of torture, the extraction of confessions, the use of 
the public execution, the body and spectacle for the reproduction 
of truth had long isolated penal practice from the common forms of 
demonstration: semi-proofs produced semi-truths and semi-guilty 
persons, words extracted by pain had greater authenticity, presump 
tion involved a degree of punishment. The heterogeneity of this 
system with the ordinary system of proof really constituted a scandal 
only when the power to punish needed, for its own economy, a 
climate of irrefutable certainty. How can one link absolutely in the 
minds of men the idea of crime and the idea of punishment, if the 
reality of the punishment does not follow, in all cases, the reality 
of the offence? To establish the offence, in all evidence, and accord 
ing to’ the means valid for all, becomes a task of first importance. 
The verification of the crime must obey the general criteria for all 
truth. In the arguments it employs, in the proofs it provides, legal 
judgement must be homogeneous with judgement in general. There 
is, therefore, an abandonment of legal proof, a rejection of torture, 
the need for a complete demonstration of the truth, an cffaccment 
of all correlation between degrees of suspicion and degrees of 
punishment. Like a mathematical truth, the truth of the crime will 
be accepted only when it is completely proven. It follows that, up 
to the final demonstration of his crime, the defendant must be 
regarded as innocent; and that, in order to carry out this demonstra 
tion, the judge must use not ritual forms, but common instruments, 
that reason possessed by everyone, which is also that of philoso 
phers and scientists: 'In theory, I regard the magistrate as a philoso 
pher who sets out to discover an interesting truth. . . His sagacity 
will enable him to grasp all the circumstances and all the relations, 
bring together or separate w-hatever needs to be brought together 
or separated in order to arrive at a sane judgement' (Seigneux de 
Correvon, 49). The investigation, the exercise of common reason, 
lays aside the old inquisitorial model and adopts the much more 
subtle model (doubly validated by science and common sense) of 
empirical research. The judge will be like a 'pilot steering between 
the rocks’: ‘What proofs or what clues will be considered to be 
sufficient neither I nor anyone else has dared to determine in general; 
since circumstances are subject to infinite variations, since proofs 
and clues must be deduced from these circumstances, the clearest
clues and proofs must necessarily vary in proportion' (Risi, 53). 
Henceforth, penal practice was to be subject to a common rule of 
truth, or rather to a complex rule in which heterogeneous elements 
of scientific demonstration, the evidence of the senses and common 
sense come together to form the judge's ‘deep-seated conviction'. 
Although penal justice preserves the forms that guarantee its equity, 
it may now be opened up to all manner of truths, providing they 
are evident, well founded, acceptable to all. The legal ritual in itself 
no longer generates a divided truth. It is resituated in the field of 
reference of common proofs. With the multiplicity of scientific 
discourses, a difficult, infinite relation was then forged that penal 
justice is still unable to control. The master of justice is no longer 
the master of its truth. 

The rule of optimal specification. For penal semiotics to cover the 
whole field of illegalities that one wishes to eliminate, all offences 
must be defined; they must be classified and collected into species 
from which none of them can escape. A code is therefore necessary 
and this code must be sufficiently precise for each type of offence to 
be clearly present in it. The silence of the law must not harbour the 
hope of impunity. An exhaustive, explicit code is required, defining 
crimes and fixing penalties. (On this theme, cf., among others, 
Linguct, 8.) But the same imperative need for a total coincidence 
between all possible offences and the effects-signs of punishment 
forces one to go further. The idea of the same punishment docs not 
have the same effect on everyone: the rich do not fear fines nor the 
notorious infamy. The injury caused by an offence and its value as 
example differ according to the status of the offender; a crime 
committed by a noble is more injurious to society than one com 
mitted by a man of the people (Lacretelle, 144). Lastly, since punish 
ment must prevent a repetition of the offence, it must take into 
account the profound nature of the criminal himself, the presumable 
degree of his wickedness, the intrinsic quality of his will: 'Of two 
men who have committed the same theft, how much less guilty is he 
who scarcely had the necessities of life than he who overflowed with 
excess? Of two perjurers, how much more criminal is he on whom 
one has striven from his childhood to impress feelings of honour 
than he who, abandoned to nature, never received the benefit of 
education’ (Marat, 34). One sees the emergence at the same time of 
the need for a parallel classification of crimes and punishments, the 
need for an individualization of sentences, in accordance with the 
particular characteristics of each criminal. This individualization was 
to weigh very heavily throughout the history of modern penal law; 
it is rooted precisely here: in terms of the theory of law and accord 
ing to the requirements of everyday practice, it is no doubt in 
radical opposition to the principle of codification; but from the 
standpoint of the economy of the power to punish, and of the 
techniques by which one wishes to circulate throughout the social 
body precisely calibrated signs of punishment, with neither excesses 
nor loopholes, with neither a useless 'expenditure' of power nor with 
timidity, it becomes evident that the codification of the offences- 
punishments system and the modulation of the criminal-punish 
ment dyad go side by side, each requiring the other. Individualiza 
tion appears as the ultimate aim of a precisely adapted code. 

But this individualization is very different in its nature from the 
modulations of punishment to be found in the old jurisprudence. 
The old system - and on this point it followed Christian peniten 
tiary practice - used two scries of variables to adjust the punishment, 
those of'circumstances' and those of‘intention’; elements, that is to 
say, that made it possible to qualify the act itself. The modulation 
of the penalty belonged to ‘casuistry’ in the broad sense. (On the 
non-individualizing character of casuistry, cf. Cariou.) But what 
was now beginning to emerge was a modulation that referred to the 
defendant himself, to his nature, to his way of life and his attitude of 
m nd, to his past, to the 'quality* and not to the intention of his will. 
One perceives, but as a place as yet unfilled, the locus in which, in 
penal practice, psychological knowledge will take over the role of 
casuistic jurisprudence. Of course, at the end of the eighteenth 
century, that moment was still far off. The code-individualization 
link was sought in the scientific models of the period. Natural 
history no doubt offered the most adequate schema: the taxonomy 
of species according to an uninterrupted gradation. One sought to 
constitute a Linnaeus of crimes and punishments, so that each 
particular offence and each punishable individual might come, with 
out the slightest risk of any arbitrary action, within the provisions 
of a general law. 'A table must be drawn up of all the genera of 
crimes to be observed in different countries. According to the 
enumeration ol crimes, a division into species must be carried out. 
The best rule of this division is, it seems to me, to separate the 
crimes according to their objects. This division must be such that 
each species is quite distinct from another, and that each particular 
crime, considered in all its relations may be placed between that 
which must precede it and that which must follow it, in the strictest 
gradation; lastly, this table must be such that it may be compared 
with another table that will be drawn up for penalties, in such a way 
that they may correspond exactly to one another’ (Lacretelle, 351- 
352). In theory, or rather in dream, the double taxonomy of 
punishments and crimes will solve the problem: but how is one to 
apply fixed laws to particular individuals? 

Far removed from this speculative model, forms of anthropologi 
cal individualization were being constituted at the same period in 
what was still a very rough and ready way. Let us take first the 
notion of the repetition of crime. Not that this was unknown to the 
old criminal laws. 11 But it was tending to become a description 
of the defendant himself capable of altering the sentence passed: 
according to the legislation of 1791, recidivists were liable in almost 
all cases to a doubling of the penalty; according to the law of Flor&l 
Year X, they had to be branded with the letter R; and the penal code 
of 1810 inflicted on them cither the maximum possible of the normal 
penalty, or the penalty immediately above it. Now, through the 
repetition of the crime, what one was aiming at was not the author 
of an act defined by law, but the delinquent subject himself, a certain 
will that manifested his intrinsically criminal character. Gradually, 
as criminality, rather than crime, became the object of penal inter 
vention, the opposition between first offender and recidivist tended 
to become more important. And on the basis of this opposition, 
reinforcing it on several points, one sees at the same period the 
formation of the notion of the 'crime passionel' - an involuntary, 
unpremeditated crime, bound up with extraordinary circumstances, 
which, while not offering the same excuse as madness, nevertheless 
prevented it from being regarded as an ordinary crime. As early as 
1791, Lc Peletier remarked that the subtle gradation of penalties 
that he had presented to the Constituent Assembly might dissuade 
from crime ‘the evil-doer who plans a wicked action in cold blood’, 
and who may be restrained by thoughts of the penalty; but, on the 


other hand, it was powerless against crimes due to ‘violent passions 
that have no regard to consequences’; this, however, was unimport 
ant, since such crimes revealed in their authors ‘no reasoned wicked 
ness.’ 1 * 

Beneath the humanization of the penalties, what one finds are all 
those rules that authorize, or rather demand, ’leniency’, as a calcu 
lated economy of the power to punish. But they also provoke a 
shift in the point of application of this power: it is no longer the 
body, with the ritual play of excessive pains, spectacular brandings 
in the ritual of the public execution; it is the mind or rather a play 
of representations and signs circulating discreetly but necessarily 
and evidently in the minds of all. It is no longer the body, but the 
soul, said Mably. And we see very clearly what he meant by this 
term: the correlative of a technique of power. Old ’anatomies' of 
punishment are abandoned. But have we really entered the age of 
non-corporal punishment? 

At the point of departure, then, one may place the political 
project of rooting out illegalities, generalizing the punitive function 
and delimiting, in order to control it, the power to punish. From 
this there emerge two lines of objectification of crime and of the 
criminal. On the one hand, the criminal designated as the enemy of 
all, whom it is in the interest of all to track down, falls outside the 
pact, disqualifies himself as a citizen and emerges, bearing within 
him as it were, a wild fragment of nature; he appears as a villain, 
a monster, a madman, perhaps, a sick and, before long, ‘abnormal’ 
individual. It is as such that, one day, he will belong to a scientific 
objectification and to the 'treatment' that is correlative to it. On the 
other hand, the need to measure, from within, the effects of the 
punitive power prescribes tactics of intervention over all criminals, 
actual or potential: the organization of a field of prevention, the 
calculation of interests, the circulation of representations and signs, 
the constitution of a horizon of certainty and proof, the adjustment 
of penalties to ever more subtle variables; all this also leads to an 
objectification of criminals and crimes. In either case, one sees that 
the power relation that underlies the exercise of punishment begins 
to be duplicated by an object relation in which are caught up not 
only die crime as a fact to be established according to common 
norms, but the criminal as an individual to be known according 
to specific criteria. One also sees that this object relation is not 
superimposed, from the outside, on the punitive practice, as would 
be a prohibition laid on the fury of the public execution by the 
limits of the sensibility, or as would be a rational or 'scientific' 
interrogation as to what this man that one is punishing really is. The 
processes of objectification originate in the very tactics of power and 
of the arrangement of its exercise. 

However, the two types of objectification that emerge with the 
project of penal reform are very different from one another: both in 
their chronology and in their effects. The objectification of the 
criminal as outside the law, as natural man, is still only a potentiality, 
a vanishing trace, in which are entangled the themes of political 
criticism and the figures of the imagination. One will have to wait a 
long time before homo crimina/is becomes a definite object in the 
field of knowledge. The other, on the contrary, has had much more 
rapid and decisive effects in so far as it was linked more directly 
to the reorganization of the power to punish: codification, definition 
of offences, the fixing of a scale of penalties, rules of procedure, 
definition of the role of magistrates. And also because it made use 
of the discourse already constituted by the Ideologues. This discourse 
provided, in effect, by means of the theory of interests, representa 
tions and signs, by the series and geneses that it reconstituted, a sort 
of general recipe for the exercise of power over men: the 'mind' as 
a surface of inscription for power, with semiology as its tool; the 
submission of bodies through the control of ideas; the analysis of 
representations as a principle in a politics of bodies that was much 
more effective than the ritual anatomy of torture and execution. The 
thought of the Ideologues was not only a theory of the individual 
and society; it developed as a technology of subtle, effective, 
economic powers, in opposition to the sumptuous expenditure of 
the power of the sovereign. Let us hear once more what Servan has 
to say: the ideas of crime and punishment must be strongly linked 
and ‘follow one another without interruption. . . When you have 
thus formed the chain of ideas in the heads of your citizens, you will 
then be able to pride yourselves on guiding them and being their 
masters. A stupid despot may constrain his slaves with iron chains; 
but a true politician binds them even more strongly by the chain of 


their own ideas; it is at the stable point of reason that he secures the 
end of the chain; this link is all the stronger in that we do not know 
of what it is made and we believe it to be our own work; despair 
and time eat away the bonds of iron and steel, but they are power 
less against the habitual union of ideas, they can only tighten it still 
more; and on the soft fibres of the brain is founded the unshakable 
base of the soundest of Empires' (Servan, 3 f)- 
It is this semio-techniquc of punishments, this ‘ideological 
power' which, partly at least, will remain in suspense and will be 
superseded by a new political anatomy, in which the body, once 
again, but in a new form, will be the principal character. And this 
new political anatomy will permit the intersection of the two 
divergent lines of objectification that are to be seen emerging in the 
eighteenth century: that which rejects the criminal 'from the other 
side' - from the side of a nature against nature; and that which seeks 
to control delinquency by a calculated economy of punishments. A 
glance at the new art of punishing clearly reveals the supersession 
of the punitive semio-techniquc by a new politics of the body.
