&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This enables us to understand some of the characteristics of the 
liturgy of torture and execution - above all, the importance of a 
ritual that was to deploy its pomp in public. Nothing was to be 
hidden of this triumph of the law. Its episodes were traditionally the 
same and yet the sentences never failed to list them, so important 
were they in the penal mechanism: processions, halts at crossroads 
and church doors, the public reading of the sentence, kneeling, 
declarations of repentance for the offence to God and to the king. 
Sometimes questions of precedence and ceremonial were settled by 
the court itself: ‘The officers will ride according to the following 
order: namely, at the head two police sergeants; then the patient; 
after the patient, Bonfort and Le Corre on his left will walk together, 
followed by the clerk of the court and in this manner shall go to the 
market square at which place the judgement shall be carried out' 
(quoted in Corre, 7). Now, this meticulous ceremonial was not only 
legal, but quite explicitly military. The justice of the king was 
shown to be an armed justice. The sw’ord that punished the guilty’ 
was also the sword that destroyed enemies. A whole military machine 
surrounded the scaffold: cavalry of the watch, archers, guardsmen, 
soldiers. This was intended, of course, to prevent any escape or 
show of force; it was also to prevent any outburst of sympathy or 
anger on the part of the people, any attempt to save the condemned 
or to have them immediately put to death; but it was also a reminder 
that every crime constituted as it were a rebellion against the law 
and that the criminal was an enemy of the prince. All these reasons - 
whether a matter of precaution in particular circumstances or a 
functional element in the performance of the ritual - made the public 
execution more than an act of justice; it was a manifestation of 
force; or rather, it was justice as the physical, material and awesome 
force of the sovereign deployed there. The ceremony of the public 
torture and execution displayed for all to see the power relation 
that gave his force to the law. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a ritual of armed law, in which the prince showed himself, 
indissociably, both as head of justice and head of war, the public 
execution had two aspects: one of victory, the other of struggle. 
It brought to a solemn end a war, the outcome of which was 
decided in advance, between the criminal and the sovereign; it had 
to manifest the disproportion of power of the sovereign over those 
whom he had reduced to impotence. The dissymmetry, the irre 
versible imbalance of forces were an essential element in the public 
execution. A body effaced, reduced to dust and thrown to the winds, 
a body destroyed piece by piece by the infinite power of the sover 
eign constituted not only the ideal, but the real limit of punishment. 
Take the celebrated torture and execution of Massola, which took
place at Avignon and which was one of the first to arouse the 
indignation of contemporaries. This was an apparently paradoxical 
???rremony, since it took place almost entirely after death, and since 
justice did little more than deploy its magnificent theatre, the ritual 
praise of its force, on a corpse. The condemned man was blind- 
folded and tied to a stake; all around, on the scaffold, were stakes 
with iron hooks. ‘The confessor whispered in the patient’s car and, 
after he had given him the blessing, the executioner, who had an 
iron bludgeon of the kind used in slaughter houses, delivered a blow 
with all his might on the temple of the wretch, who fell dead: the 
mortis exactor , who had a large knife, then cut his throat, which 
spattered him with blood; it was a horrible sight to see; he severed 
the sinews near the two heels, and then opened up the belly from 
which he drew the heart, liver, spleen and lungs, which he stuck on 
an iron hook, and cut and dissected into pieces, which he then stuck 
on the other hooks as he cut them, as one docs with an animal. 
Look who can at such a sight' (Bruncau, 159). In the explicit 
reference to the butcher’s trade, the infinitesimal destruction of the 
l»ody is linked here with spectacle: each piece is placed on display. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The execution was accompanied by a whole ceremonial of 
triumph; but it also included, as a dramatic nucleus in its monotonous 
progress, a scene of confrontation: this was the immediate, direct 
action of the executioner on the body of the 'patient'. It was a coded 
action, of course, since custom and, often quite explicitly, the sen 
tence prescribed its principal episodes. Nevertheless, it did preserve 
uimething of the battle. The executioner not only implemented the 
law, he also deployed the force; he was the agent of a violence applied, 
in order to master it, to the violence of the crime. Materially, physic 
ally, he was the adversary of this crime: an adversary who could show 
pity or ruthlessness. Damhoudcre complained, with many of his 
contemporaries, that the executioners exercised ‘every cruelty with 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regard to the evil-doing patients, treating them, buffeting and killing 
them as if they had a beast in their hands' (Damhoudcre, 219). And 
for a long time the habit did not die out. 3 There was still an clement 
of challenge and of jousting in the ceremony of public execution. 
If the executioner triumphed, if he managed to cut off the head with 
a single blow, he ‘showed it to the people, put it down on the ground 
and then 'waved to the public who greatly applauded his skill by
clapping’. (A scene observed by T. S. Gueulctte, at the execution of 
Montigny in 1737 - cf. Anchel, 62-9.) Conversely, if he failed, if he 
did not succeed in killing the ‘patient’ as required, he was liable to 
punishment. This was the case of Damiens’s executioner who, being 
unable to quarter his patient according to the rules, had to cut him 
up with a knife; as a result, Damiens’s hair, which had been prom 
ised to him, was confiscated and the money obtained from the sale 
given to the poor. Some years later, an executioner at Avignon 
caused excessive pain to three bandits, who were nevertheless 
formidable characters, whom he had to hang; the spectators became 
angry; they denounced him; in order to punish him and also to 
protect him from mob violence, he was put into prison (Duhamel, 
25). And, behind this punishment of the unskilful executioner, 
stands a tradition, which is still close to us, according to which the 
condemned man should be pardoned if the execution happened to 
fail. It was a custom clearly established in certain countries: in 
Burgundy, for instance (cf. Chassan^c, 55). The people often 
expected it to be applied, and would sometimes protect a condemned 
man who had escaped death in this way. In order to abolish both 
custom and expectation, they had to revive the adage, ‘the gibbet 
docs not lose its prey’, to introduce explicit instructions in capital 
sentences, such as ‘hanged by the neck until he be dead'. And jurists 
like Scrpillon or Blackstonc were insisting in the middle of the 
eighteenth century that a failure on the part of the executioner did 
not mean that the condemned man's life was spared (Scrpillon, III, 
1 too). In his Commentaries on the Laws of England , Blackstonc 
remarks: ‘It is clear, that if, upon judgement to be hanged by the 
neck till he is dead, the criminal be not thoroughly killed, but 
revives, the sheriff must hang him again. For the former hanging 
was no execution of the sentence; and, if a false tenderness were to 
be indulged in such cases, a multitude of collusions might ensue' 
(Blackstone, 199). There was something of the ordeal and something 
of God’s judgement that was still indecipherable in the ceremony of 
execution. In his confrontation with the condemned man, the execu 
tioner was a little like the king’s champion. Yet he was an unacknow- 
ledgeable and unacknowledged champion: the tradition was, it seems, 
that when the executioner’s letters were sealed, they were not placed 
on the table, but thrown on the ground. The various prohibitions 


surrounding this ‘very necessary’ yet ‘unnatural’ office are well 
known (Loyseau, 80-81). The executioner may have been, in a 
vense, the king’s sword, but he shared the infamy of his adversary. 
The sovereign power that enjoined him to kill, and which through 
him did kill, was not present in him; it was not identified with his 
own ruthlessness. And it never appeared with more spectacular 
effect than when it interrupted the executioner’s gesture with a letter 
of pardon. The short time that usually elapsed between sentence 
and execution (often a few hours) meant that the pardon usually 
arrived at the very last moment. But the ceremony, by the very 
slowness of its progress, was no doubt arranged to leave room for 
this eventuality. (Cf. Hardy, 30 January 1769, 1 ,115 ant * M Decem 
ber 1779, IV, 229; Anchel, 162-3, tells the story of Antoine Boulle- 
teix, who was already at the foot of the scaffold when a horseman 
arrived carrying the celebrated parchment. Shouts of 'God save the 
King’ arose and Boulleteix was taken to the tavern, while the clerk 
of the court made a collection on his behalf.) The condemned 
always hoped for a pardon and, in order to drag things out, they 
would pretend, even at the foot of the scaffold, that they had further 
revelations to make. When the people wanted a pardon they called 
for it aloud and tried to postpone the last moment, looking out for 
the arrival of the messenger bearing the letter with the green wax 
veal and if necessary claiming that he was on his way (this happened 
during the execution of those condemned for the uprising against 
child abduction on 3 August 1750). The sovereign was present at 
the execution not only as the power exacting the vengeance of the 
law, but as the power that could suspend both law and vengeance. 
He alone must remain master, he alone could wash away the offences 
committed on his person; although it is true that he delegated to the 
courts the task of exercising his power to dispense justice, he had 
not transferred it; he retained it in its entirety and he could suspend 
the sentence or increase it at will. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must regard the public execution, as it was still ritualized in 
the eighteenth century, as a political operation. It was logically 
inscribed in a system of punishment, in w hich the sovereign, directly 
or indirectly, demanded, decided and carried out punishments, in 
so far as it was he who, through the law, had been injured by the 
crime. In every offence there was a crimen majestatis and in the least
criminal a potential regicide. And the regicide, in turn, was neither 
more nor less, than the total, absolute criminal since, instead of 
attacking, like any offender, a particular decision or wish of the 
sovereign power, he attacked the very principle and physical person 
of the prince. The ideal punishment of the regicide had to constitute 
the summum of all possible tortures. It would be an expression of 
infinite vengeance: French law, in any case, made provisions for no 
fixed penalties for this sort of monstrosity. For the execution of 
Ravaillac the form of the ceremony had to be invented, by combin 
ing all the cruellest tortures then practised in France. For Damiens, 
an attempt was made to think up still more atrocious tortures. 
Suggestions were made, but they were considered to be less perfect. 
So the form of Ravaillac’s execution was repeated. And it must be 
admitted that it was relatively modest if one thinks how in 1584 the 
assassin of William of Orange was abandoned to what seems like an 
infinity of vengeance. ‘On the first day, he was taken to the square 
where he found a cauldron of boiling water, in which was submerged 
the arm with which he had committed the crime. The next day the 
arm was cut off, and, since it fell at his feet, he was constantly 
kicking it up and down the scaffold; on the third day, red-hot 
pincers were applied to his breasts and the front of his arm; on the 
fourth day, the pincers were applied similarly on the back of his 
arm and on his buttocks; and thus, consecutively, this man was 
tortured for eighteen days.' On the last day, he was put to the wheel 
and 'maillott' [beaten with a wooden club]. After six hours, he was 
still asking for water, which was not given him. 'Finally the police 
magistrate was begged to put an end to him by strangling, so that 
his soul should not despair and be lost' (Brantomc, II, 191-2). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be no doubt that the existence of public tortures and 
executions were connected with something quite other than this 
internal organization. Rusche and Kirchheimer are right to see it as 
the effect of a system of production in which labour power, and 
therefore the human body, has neither the utility nor the commercial 
value that are conferred on them in an economy of an industrial 
type. Moreover, this ‘contempt’ for the body is certainly related to 
a general attitude to death; and, in such an attitude, one can detect 
not only the values proper to Christianity, but a demographical,
in a sense biological, situation: the ravages of disease and hunger, 
the periodic massacres of the epidemics, the formidable child mor 
tality rate, the precariousness of the bio-economic balances — all this 
made death familiar and gave rise to rituals intended to integrate it, 
to make it acceptable and to give a meaning to its permanent 
aggression. But in analysing why the public executions survived for 
so long, one must also refer to the historical conjuncture; it must 
not be forgotten that the ordinance of 1670 that regulated criminal 
justice almost up to the Revolution had even increased in certain 
respects the rigour of the old edicts; Pussort, who, among the com 
missioners entrusted with the task of drawing up the documents, 
represented the intentions of the king, was responsible for this, 
despite the views of such magistrates as Lamoignon; the number of 
uprisings at the very height of the classical age, the rumbling close 
at hand of civil war, the king’s desire to assert his power at the 
expense of the parlements go a long way to explain the survival of 
so severe a penal system. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accounting for a penal system involving so much torture, these 
are general and in a sense external reasons; they explain not only 
the possibility and the long survival of physical punishments, but 
also the weakness and the rather sporadic nature of the opposition 
to them. Against this general background we must bring out their 
precise function. If torture was so strongly embedded in legal 
practice, it was because it revealed truth and showed the operation 
of power. It assured the articulation of the written on the oral, the 
secret on the public, the procedure of investigation on the operation 
of the confession; it made it possible to reproduce the crime on the 
visible body of the criminal; in the same horror, the crime had to 
be manifested and annulled. It also made the body of the condemned 
man the place where the vengeance of the sovereign was applied, 
the anchoring point for a manifestation of power, an opportunity 
of affirming the dissymmetry of forces. We shall sec later that the 
trutli-power relation remains at the heart of all mechanisms of 
punishment and that it is still to be found in contemporary penal 
practice - but in a quite different form and with very’ different effects. 
The Enlightenment was soon to condemn public torture and execu 
tion as an ‘atrocity’ - a term that was often used to describe it, but 
without any critical intention, by jurists themselves. Perhaps the
notion of‘atrocity’ is one of those that best designates the economy 
of the public execution in the old penal practice. To begin with, 
atrocity is a characteristic of some of the great crimes: it refers to the 
number of natural or positive, divine or human laws that they 
attack, to the scandalous openness or, on the contrary, to the secret 
cunning with which they have been committed, to the rank and 
status of those who are their authors and victims, to the disorder 
that they presuppose or bring with them, to the horror they 
arouse. In so far as it must bring the crime before everyone’s eyes, 
in all its severity, the punishment must take responsibility for this 
atrocity: it must bring it to light by confessions, statements, inscrip 
tions that make it public; it must reproduce it in ceremonies that 
apply it to the body of the guilty person in the form of humiliation 
and pain. Atrocity is that part of the crime that the punishment 
turns back as torture in order to display it in the full light of day: 
it is a figure inherent in the mechanism that produces the visible 
truth of the crime at the very heart of the punishment itself. The 
public execution formed part of the procedure that established the 
reality of what one punished. Furthermore, the atrocity of a crime 
was also the violence of the challenge flung at the sovereign; it was 
that which would move him to make a reply whose function was to 
go further than this atrocity, to master it, to overcome it by an 
excess that annulled it. The atrocity that haunted the public execu 
tion played, therefore, a double role: it was the principle of the 
communication between the crime and the punishment, it was also 
the exacerbation of the punishment in relation to the crime. It pro 
vided the spectacle with both truth and power; it was the culmina 
tion of the ritual of the investigation and the ceremony in which the 
sovereign triumphed. And it joined both together in the tortured 
body. The punitive practice of the nineteenth century was to strive 
to put as much distance as possible between the ’serene' search for 
truth and the violence that cannot be entirely effaced from punish 
ment. It set out to mark the heterogeneity that separates the crime 
that is to be punished and the punishment imposed by the public 
power. Between truth and punishment, there should no longer be 
any other relation than one of legitimate consequence. The punish 
ing power should not soil its hands with a crime greater than the 
one it wished to punish. It should remain innocent of the penalty
that it inflicts. 'Let us hasten to proscribe such tortures. They were 
wonhy only of the crowned monsters who governed the Romans’ 
(Pastoret, on the subject of the punishment of regicides, II, 61). But, 
according to the penal practice of the preceding period, the proxim 
ity in the public execution of the sovereign and the crime, the mix 
ture that was produced in it of 'demonstration' and punishment, 
were not the result of a barbarous confusion; what joined them 
together was the mechanism of atrocity and its necessary concatena 
tions. The atrocity of the expiation organized the ritual destruction 
of infamy by omnipotence. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the crime and the punishment were related and 
bound up in the form of atrocity was not the result of some ob 
scurely accepted law of retaliation. It was the effect, in the rites of 
punishment, of a certain mechanism of power: of a power that not 
only did not hesitate to exert itself directly on bodies, but was 
exalted and strengthened by its visible manifestations; of a power 
that asserted itself as an armed power whose functions of maintain 
ing order were not entirely unconnected with the functions of war; 
of a power that presented rules and obligations as personal bonds, a 
breach of which constituted an offence and called for vengeance; 
of a power for which disobedience was an act of hostility, the first 
sign of rebellion, which is not in principle different from civil war; 
of a power that had to demonstrate not why it enforced its laws, 
but who were its enemies, and what unleashing of force threatened 
them; of a power which, in the absence of continual supervision, 
sought a renewal of its effect in the spectacle of its individual mani 
festations; of a power that was recharged in the ritual display of its 
reality as 'super-power'. 

Of all the reasons why punishment that was not in the least 
ashamed of being ‘atrocious’ was replaced by punishment that was 
to claim the honour of being 'humane' there is one that must be 
analysed at once, for it is internal to the public execution itself: at 
once an element of its functioning and the principle of its perpetual 
disorder. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ceremonies of the public execution, the main character was 
the people, whose real and immediate presence was required for the 
performance. An execution that was known to be taking place, but
which did so in secret, would scarcely have had any meaning. The 
aim was to make an example, not only by making people aware that 
the slightest offence was likely to be punished, but by arousing 
feelings of terror by the spectacle of power letting its anger fall upon 
the guilty person: 'In criminal matters, the most difficult point is 
the imposition of the penalty: it is the aim and the end of the 
procedure, and its only fruit, by example and terror, when it is well 
applied to the guilty person' (Bruneau, unnumbered preface to the 
first part). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in this scene of terror, the role of the people was an ambigu 
ous one. People were summoned as spectators: they were assembled 
to observe public exhibitions and amtndes honorabler ,; pillories, 
gallows and scaffolds were erected in public squares or by the road 
side; sometimes the corpses of the executed persons were displayed 
for several days near the scenes of their crimes. Not only must 
people know, they must see with their own eyes. Because they must 
be made to be afraid; but also because they must be the witnesses, 
the guarantors, of the punishment, and because they must to a 
certain extent take part in it. The right to be witnesses was one that 
they possessed and claimed; a hidden execution was a privileged 
execution, and in such cases it was often suspected that it had not 
taken place with all its customary severity. There were protests 
when at the last moment the victim was taken away out of sight. 
The senior postal official who had been put on public exhibition 
for killing his wife was later taken away from the crowd. 'He was 
put into a hired coach; it was thought that if he had not been well 
escorted, it would have been difficult to protect him from being 
ill-treated by the populace, who yelled and jeered at him' (Hardy, I, 
328). When the woman Lescombat was hanged, care was taken to 
hide her face; she had 'a kerchief over her neck and head, which 
made the public murmur and say that it was not Lescombat’ 
(Anchcl, 70-71). The people claimed the right to observe the execu 
tion and to see who was being executed. The first time the guillotine 
was used the Chronique de Paris reported that people complained 
that they could not see anything and chanted, ‘Give us back our 
gallows’ (Lawrence, 71 ff). The people also had a right to take part. 
The condemned man, carried in procession, exhibited, humiliated, 
with the horror of his crime recalled in innumerable ways, was 
offered to the insults, sometimes to the attacks of the spectators. 
The vengeance of the people was called upon to become an un 
obtrusive pan of the vengeance of the sovereign. Not that it was 
in any way fundamental, or that the king had to express in his own 
way the people's revenge; it was rather that the people had to bring 
its assistance to the king when the king undertook ‘to be avenged 
on his enemies', especially when those enemies were to be found 
among the people. It was rather like a ‘scaffold service' that the 
people owed the king’s vengeance. This ‘service’ had been specified 
in the old ordinances; the edict of 1347 concerning blasphemers 
stipulated that they would be exhibited at the pillory ‘from the hour 
of prime, to that of their deaths. And mud and other refuse, though 
no stone or anything injurious, could be thrown at their faces. . . 
The second time, in case of relapse, it is our will that he be put in the 
pillory on a solemn market day, and that his upper lip be split so 
that the teeth appear.' No doubt, at the classical period, this form 
of participation in the torture was no more than tolerated and 
attempts were made to limit it: because of the barbarities that it gave 
rise to and the usurpation it involved of the power to punish. But it 
belonged too closely to the general economy of the public execution 
for it to be eliminated altogether. Even in the eighteenth century, 
there were scenes like the one that accompanied the execution of 
Montigny in 1737; as the executioner was carrying out the execu 
tion, the local fish-wives walked in procession, holding aloft an 
effigy of the condemned man, and then cut off its head (Anchcl, 63). 
And very often, as they moved slowly in procession through it, 
criminals had to be 'protected' from the crowd - both as an example 
and as a target, a possible threat and a 'prey', promised but also 
forbidden. In calling on the crowd to manifest its power, the 
sovereign tolerated for a moment acts of violence, which he accepted 
as a sign of allegiance, but which were strictly limited by the sover 
eign’s own privileges. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it was on this point that the people, drawn to the spectacle 
intended to terrorize it, could express its rejection of the punitive 
power and sometimes revolt. Preventing an execution that was 
regarded as unjust, snatching a condemned man from the hands of 
the executioner, obtaining his pardon by force, possibly pursuing 
and assaulting the executioners, in any case abusing the judges and
causing an uproar against the sentence - all this formed part of the 
popular practices that invested, traversed and often overturned the 
ritual of the public execution. This often happened, of course, in the 
case of those condemned for rioting: there were the disturbances 
that followed a famous case of child abduction, when the crowd 
wanted to prevent the execution of three supposed rioters, who were 
to be hanged at the cemetery of Saint-Jean, 'because there were 
fewer entrances and processions to guard’; 4 the terrified executioner 
cut down one of the condemned men; the archers let fly their arrows. 
It occurred again after the com riots of 1775; and again in 1786, 
when the day-labourers marched on Versailles and set about freeing 
their arrested comrades. But apart from these cases, when the pro 
cess of agitation had been triggered off previously and for reasons 
that did not concern some measure of penal justice, one finds many 
examples when the agitation was provoked directly by a verdict 
and an execution: small, but innumerable 'disturbances around the 
scaffold’. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their most elementary forms, these disturbances began with the 
shouts of encouragement, sometimes the cheering, that accompanied 
the condemned man to his execution. Throughout the long proces 
sion, he was sustained by 'the compassion of the meek and tender 
hearted, and with the applause, admiration and envy of all the bold 
and hardened’ (Fielding, 449). If the crowd gathered round the 
scaffold, it was not simply to witness the sufferings of the condemned 
man or to excite the anger of the executioner: it was also to hear an 
individual who had nothing more to lose curse the judges, the laws, 
the government and religion. The public execution allowed the 
luxury of these momentary saturnalia, when nothing remained to 
prohibit or to punish. Under the protection of imminent death, the 
criminal could say everything and the crowd cheered. 'If there were 
annals in which the last words of the tortured and executed were 
scrupulously recorded, and if one had the courage to read through 
them, even if one did no more than question the vile populace that 
gathers around the scaffolds out of cruel curiosity, one would be told 
that no one who had died on the wheel did not accuse heaven for the 
misery that brought him to the crime, reproach his judges for their 
barbarity, curse the minister of the altars who accompanies them 
and blaspheme against the God whose organ he is’ (Boucher
d’Argis, 128-9). In these executions, which ought to show only the 
terrorizing power of the prince, there was a whole aspect of the 
carnival, in which rules were inverted, authority mocked and 
criminals transformed into heroes. The shame was turned round; 
the courage, like the tears and the cries of the condemned, caused 
offence only to the law. Fielding notes with regret: 'To unite the 
ideas of death and shame is not so easy as may be imagined ... I 
will appeal to any man who hath seen an execution, or a procession 
to an execution; let him tell me. When he hath beheld a poor 
wretch, bound in a cart, just on the verge of eternity, all pale and 
trembling with his approaching fate, whether the idea of shame 
hath ever intruded on his mind? much less will the bold daring 
rogue, who glories in his present condition, inspire the beholder 
with any such sensation’ (Fielding, 450). For the people who are 
there and observe, there is always, even in the most extreme ven 
geance of the sovereign a pretext for revenge. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was especially the case if the conviction was regarded as 
unjust - or if One saw a man of the people put to death, for a crime 
that would have merited, for someone better born or richer, a com 
paratively light penalty. It would seem that certain practices of penal 
justice were no longer supported in the eighteenth century - and 
perhaps for longer - by the lower strata of the population. This 
would explain why executions could easily lead to the beginnings 
of social disturbances. Since the poorest - it was a magistrate who 
mide the observation (Dupaty, 1786, 247) - could not be heard in 
the courts of law, it was where the law was manifested publicly, 
where they were called upon to act as witnesses and almost as co 
adjutors of this law, that they could intervene, physically: enter by 
force into the punitive mechanism and redistribute its effects; take 
up in another sense the violence of the punitive rituals. There was 
agitation against the difference in penalties according to social class: 
in 1781, the parish priest of Champre had been killed by the lord 
of the manor, and an attempt was made to declare the murderer 
insane; 'the peasants, who were extremely attached to their pastor, 
were furious and had at first seemed ready to lay violent hands upon 
their lord and to set fire to the castle. . . Everyone protested, and 
rightly, against the indulgence of the minister who deprived justice 
of the means of punishing so abominable a crime’
There was agitation, too, against the excessive sentences passed on 
certain common offences that were not regarded as serious (such as 
house-breaking); or against punishments for certain offences con 
nected with social conditions such as petty larceny; the death penalty 
for this crime aroused a great deal of discontent, because there were 
many domestic servants in a single household and it was difficult 
for them, in such a case, to prove their innocence, and also because 
they could easily be victims of their employers' spite and because 
the indulgence of certain masters who shut their eyes to such 
behaviour made the fate of servants accused, condemned and hanged 
even more iniquitous. The execution of such servants often gave 
rise to protests (cf. Hardy, I, 319, 367; III, 227-8; IV, 180). There 
was a small riot in Paris in 1761 in favour of a servant woman who 
had stolen a piece of cloth from her master. Despite the fact that the 
woman admitted her guilt, handed back the material and begged for 
mercy, the master refused to withdraw his complaint; on the day 
of the execution, the local people prevented the hanging, invaded the 
merchant’s shop and looted it; in the end, the servant was pardoned, 
but a woman, who attempted, unsuccessfully, to stick a needle into 
the wicked master, was banished for three years (Anchel, 226). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One remembers the great legal affairs of the eighteenth century, 
when enlightened opinion intervened in the persons of the philoso 
phy and certain magistrates: Calas, Sirven and the Chevalier de La 
Barre, for instance. But less attention is given to the popular agita 
tions caused by punitive practice. Indeed, they seldom spread be 
yond a town, or even a district. Yet they did have a real importance. 
Sometimes these movements, which originated from below, spread 
and attracted the attention of more highly placed persons who, 
taking them up, gave them a new dimension (in the years preceding 
the Revolution, the affair of Catherine Espinas, falsely convicted of 
parricide in 1785, or the case of the three men of Chaumont, con 
demned to the wheel, for whom Dupaty, in 1786, wrote his cele 
brated memoir, or that of Marie Fran^oise Salmon, whom the 
parlement of Rouen in 1782 had condemned to the stake, for poison 
ing, but who in 1786 had still not been executed). More usually, 
those disturbances had maintained around penal justice and its 
manifestations, which ought to have been exemplary, a state of 
permanent unrest. How often had it proved necessary, in order to 
ensure order around the scaffolds, to take steps that w r ere ‘distressing 
to the people’ and ‘humiliating for the authorities’ (Argenson, 241)? 
It was evident that the great spectacle of punishment ran the risk 
of being rejected by the very people to whom it was addressed. In 
fact, the terror of the public execution created centres of illegality: 
on execution days, work stopped, the taverns were full, the authori 
ties were abused, insults or stones were thrown at the executioner, 
the guards and the soldiers; attempts were made to seire the con 
demned man, either to save him or to kill him more surely; fights 
broke out, and there w'as no better prey for thieves than the curious 
throng around the scaffold. (Hardy recounts a number of cases like 
the important theft that was committed in the very house in which 
the police magistrate was lodging - IV, j6.) But above all - and this 
was why these disadvantages became a political danger - the people 
never felt closer to those who paid the penalty than in those rituals 
intended to show the horror of the crime and the invincibility of 
power; never did the people feel more threatened, like them, by a 
legal violence exercised without moderation or restraint. The solid 
arity of a whole section of the population w'ith those we would call 
petty offenders - vagrants, false beggars, the indigent poor, pick- 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pockets, receivers and dealers in stolen goods - was constantly 
expressed: resistance to police searches, the pursuit of informers, 
attacks on the watch or inspectors provide abundant evidence of 
this (cf. Richer, 118-19). And it was the breaking up of this solidar 
ity that was becoming the aim of penal and police repression. Yet 
out of the ceremony of the public execution, out of that uncertain 
festival in which violence was instantaneously reversible, it was this 
solidarity much more than the sovereign power that was likely to 
emerge with redoubled strength. The reformers of the eighteenth 

( and nineteenth centuries were not to forget that, in the last resort, 
the executions did not, in fact, frighten the people. One of their 
first cries was to demand their abolition. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clarify the political problem posed by the intervention of the 
people in the spectacle of the executions, one need only cite two 
events. The first took place at Avignon at the end of the seventeenth 
century’. It contained all the principal elements of the theatre of 
horror the physical confrontation between the executioner and the 
condemned man, the reversal of the duel, the executioner pursued 
by the people, the condemned man saved by the ensuing riot and 
the violent inversion of the penal machinery. A murderer by the 
name of Pierre du Fort was to be hanged; several times he ‘had 
caught his feet in the steps' and had not been able to swing freely. 
‘Seeing this, the executioner had pulled his jerkin up over his face 
and struck him below the knees, on the stomach and on the belly. 
When the people saw that the executioner was causing him too 
much pain, and even believing that he was killing him down there 
with a bayonet ... moved by compassion for the patient and fury 
at the executioner, they threw stones at the scaffold just as the 
executioner knocked away the two ladders and threw the patient 
down and leaped on to his shoulders and kicked him, while the wife 
of the said executioner pulled at his feet from under the gallows. 
In doing so, they made blood come from his mouth. But the hail 
of stones came thicker - one stone even struck the hanged man on 
the head - which forced the executioner to dash to the ladder, which 
he descended so rapidly that half-way down he fell from it, and 
struck his head on the ground. Then a crowd of people fell upon 
him. He got to his feet, bayonet in hand, threatening to kill anyone 
who came near him; after falling several times, he finally got to his 
feet, only to be beaten by the crowd, rolled in the mud and nearly 
drowned in the stream, then dragged by the excited and enraged 
crowd to the University and to the Cordeliers Cemetery. His 
servant was also beaten and, with bruises on his head and body, was 
taken to the hospital where he died some days later. However, some 
strangers and unknown people mounted the ladder and cut the rope 
while others caught the hanged man from below after he had been 
hanging there longer than it took to say a full Miserere. The crowd 
then smashed the gallows and broke the executioner’s ladder into 
pieces. . . Children carried off the gallows and threw it into the 
Rhone.’ The condemned man was then taken to a cemetery ‘so that 
he should not be recaptured by the law and from there to the church 
of Sainte-Antoine’. The archbishop gave him his pardon, had him 
taken to the hospital and asked that particular care be taken of him. 
Lastly, adds the writer of the account, 'we had a new suit, two pairs 
of stockings and shoes made for him. We dressed him in new 
clothes from head to toe. Our colleagues gave him shirts, breeches 
and a wig’ (Duhamel, 5 - 6 ; scenes of this kind were still taking 


place in the nineteenth century - cf. Lawrence, 56 and 195-8). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other event took place in Paris, a century later. It was in 1775. 
shortly after the com riot. Because of the state of extreme tension 
among the people, the authorities wanted the execution to take 
place without interruption. Between the scaffold and the public, 
kept at a safe distance, two ranks of soldiers stood on guard, one 
facing the execution that was about to take place, the other facing 
the people in case of riot. Contact was broken: it was a public 
execution, but one in which the element of spectacle was neutralized, 
or rather reduced to abstract intimidation. Protected by force of 
arms, on an empty square, justice quietly did its work. If it showed 
the death that it had dealt, it was from high and far: 'The two 
gallows, which were eighteen feet high, no doubt by way of an 
example, were not set up until three o’clock in the afternoon. From 
two o'clock, the Place de Gr£ve and all the surrounding streets had 
been filled with detachments of different troops, some on foot, some 
on horse; the Swiss and the French guards continued to patrol the 
adjacent streets. No one was allowed on to the Grivc during the 
execution, and all around one could see a double row of soldiers, 
bayonets at the ready, standing back to back, so that some looked 
outwards and some into the square; the two wretches ... cried out 
all the way that they were innocent and continued to protest in like 
manner as they mounted the ladder’ (Hardy, III, 67). Whatever the 
part played by feelings of humanity for the condemned in the 
abandonment of the liturgy of the public executions, there was, in 
any case, on the part of the state power, a political fear of the effects 
of these ambiguous rituals. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an equivocal attitude appeared clearly in what might be 
called the ‘gallows speeches'. The rite of execution was so arranged 
that the condemned man would himself proclaim his guilt by the 
amende honorable that he spoke, by the placard that he displayed 
and also by the statements that he was no doubt forced to make. 
Furthermore, at the moment of the execution, it seems that he was 
given another opportunity to speak, not to proclaim his innocence, 
but to acknowledge his crime and the justice of his conviction. The 
chronicles relate a good many speeches of this kind. Were they 
actually delivered? In a number of cases, certainly. Or were they 
fictional speeches that were later circulated by way of example and 
exhortation? This, no doubt, was more often the case. What credit 
are we to accord, for example, to the account of the death of Marion 
Le Goff, who had been a famous bandit leader in Brittany in the 
mid-eighteenth century? She is supposed to have cried out from the 
scaffold: 'Fathers and mothers who hear me now, watch over your 
children and teach them well; in my childhood I was a liar and good- 
for-nothing; I began by stealing a small six-liard knife. . . Then I 
robbed pedlars and cattle dealers; finally, I led a robber band and 
that is why I am here. Tell all this to your children and let it be an 
example to them' (Corre, 257). Such a speech is too close, even in its 
turn of phrase, to the morality traditionally to be found in the 
broadsheets and pamphlets for it not to be apocryphal. But the 
existence of the 'last words of a condemned man' genre is in itself 
significant. The law required that its victim should authenticate in 
some sense the tortures that he had undergone. The criminal was 
asked to consecrate his own punishment by proclaiming the black 
ness of his crimes; he was made to say, as was Jean-Dominique 
Langlade, three times a murderer: 'Listen to my horrible, infamous 
and lamentable deed, committed in the city of Avignon, where the 
memory of me is execrable, for having inhumanly violated the 
sacred rites of friendship' (Duhamel, 31). In one sense, the broad 
sheet and the death song were the sequel to the trial; or rather they 
pursued that mechanism by which the public execution transferred 
the secret, written truth of the procedure to the body, gesture and 
speech of the criminal. Justice required these apocrypha in order to 
be grounded in truth. Its decisions were thus surrounded by all 
these posthumous 'proofs’. Sometimes, too, accounts of crimes and 
infamous lives were published, simply as propaganda, before any 
trial had taken place, in order to force the hand of a court that was 
suspected of being too tolerant. In order to discredit smugglers, the 
Compagnie des Fermcs published 'bulletins' recounting their 
crimes: in 1768, it distributed broadsheets against a certain Mon- 
tagne, the leader of a gang, of whom the writer himself says: ‘Some 
thefts have been ascribed to him the truth of which is somewhat 
uncertain ...; Montagne has been depicted as a wild beast, a second 
hyena to be hunted down; given the hotheads of the Auvergne, this 
idea has caught on' (cf. Juillard, 24). 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the effect, like the use, of this literature was equivocal. The 
condemned man found himself transformed into a hero by the sheer 
extent of his widely advertised crimes, and sometimes the affirmation 
of his belated repentance. Against the law, against the rich, the 
powerful, the magistrates, the constabulary or the watch, against 
taxes and their collectors, he appeared to have waged a struggle 
with which one all too easily identified. The proclamation of these 
crimes blew up to epic proportions the tiny struggle that passed 
unperceived in everyday life. If the condemned man was shown to 
be repentant, accepting the verdict, asking both God and man for 
forgiveness for his crimes, it was as if he had come through some 
process of purification: he died, in his own way, like a saint. But 
indomitability was an alternative claim to greatness: by not giving 
in under torture, he gave proof of a strength that no power had 
succeeded in bending: ‘On the day of the execution - this will seem 
scarcely credible -1 showed no trace of emotion, as I performed my 
amend* honorable , and when I finally lay down on the cross I showed 
no fear’ (the Complainte of J.-D. Langlade, executed at Avignon 
12 April 1768). Black hero or reconciled criminal, defender of the 
true right or an indomitable force, the criminal of the broadsheets, 
pamphlets, almanacs and adventure stories brought with him, be 
neath the apparent morality of the example not to be followed, a 
whole memory of struggles and confrontations. A convicted criminal 
could become after his death a sort of saint, his memory honoured 
and his grave respected. (This was the case of Tanguy, executed in 
Brittany about 1740. Before being convicted, it is true, he had begun 
a long penitence ordered by his confessor. Was this a conflict 
between civil justice and religious penitence? Cf. Corre, 21.) The 
criminal has been almost entirely transformed into a positive hero. 
There were those for whom glory and abomination were not dis 
sociated, but coexisted in a reversible figure. Perhaps we should sec 
this literature of crime, which proliferated around a few exemplary 
figures, 1 neither as a spontaneous form of 'popular expression’, nor 
as a concerted programme of propaganda and moralization from 
above; it was a locus in which two investments of penal practice 
met - a sort of battleground around the crime, its punishment and 
its memory. If these accounts were allowed to be printed and circu 
lated, it was because they were expected to have the effect of an
ideological control - the printing and the distribution of these 
almanacs, broadsheets, etc. was in principle subject to strict control. 
But if these true stories of everyday history were received so avidly, 
if they formed part of the basic reading of the lower classes, it was 
because people found in them not only memories, but also prece 
dents; the interest of'curiosity' is also a political interest. Thus these 
texts may be read as two-sided discourses, in the facts that they 
relate, in the effects they give to these facts and in the glory they 
confer on those ‘illustrious’ criminals, and no doubt in the very 
words they use (one should study the use of such categories as 
‘misfortune’ or 'abomination' or such epithets as ‘famous’ or 
‘lamentable’ in accounts such as The History of the Life, Great 
Robberies and Tricks of Guilleri and his Companions and of their 
Lamentable and Unhappy End.* 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should compare this literature with the 'disturbances 
around the scaffold’ in which, through the tortured body of the 
criminal, the power that condemned confronted the people that was 
the witness, the participant, the possible and indirect victim of this 
execution. In the wake of a ceremony that inadequately channelled 
the power relations it sought to ritualize, a whole mass of discourses 
appeared pursuing the same confrontation; the posthumous pro 
clamation of the crimes justified justice, but also glorified the cri 
minal. That was why the reformers of the penal system were soon 
demanding suppression of these broadsheets . 7 That was why the 
people showed so lively an interest in what served more or less as 
the minor, everyday epic of illegalities. That was why the broad 
sheets lost their importance as the political function of popular 
illegality altered. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they disappeared as a whole new literature of crime developed: a literature in which crime is glorified, because it is one of the 
fine arts, because it can be the work only of exceptional natures, 
because it reveals the monstrousness of the strong and powerful, 
because villainy is yet another mode of privilege: from the adventure 
story to de Quincey, or from the Castle of Otranto to Baudelaire, 
there is a whole aesthetic rewriting of crime, which is also the 
appropriation of criminality in acceptable forms. In appearance, it is 
the discovery of the beauty and greatness of crime; in fact, it is the 
affirmation that greatness too has a right to crime and that it even
becomes the exclusive privilege of those who are really great. The 
great murders are not for the pedlars of petty crime. While, from 
Gaboriau onwards, the literature of crime follows this first shift: by 
his cunning, his tricks, his sharp-wittedness, the criminal represented 
in this literature has made himself impervious to suspicion; and the 
struggle between two pure minds - the murderer and the detective - 
will constitute the essential form of the confrontation. We are far 
removed indeed from those accounts of the life and misdeeds of the 
criminal in which he admitted his crimes, and which recounted in 
detail the tortures of his execution: we have moved from the 
exposition of the facts or the confession to the slow process of 
discovery; from the execution to the investigation; from the phy 
sical confrontation to the intellectual struggle between criminal and 
investigator. It was not only the broadsheets that disappeared with 
the birth of a literature of crime; the glory of the rustic malefactor 
and his sombre transformation into a hero by the process of torture 
and execution went with them. The man of the people was now 
too simple to be the protagonist of subtle truths. In this new genre, 
there were no more popular heroes or great executions; the criminal 
was wicked, of course, but he was also intelligent; and although he 
was punished, he did not have to suffer. The literature of crime 
transposes to another social class the spectacle that had surrounded 
the criminal. Meanwhile the newspapers took over the task of 
recounting the grey, unheroic details of everyday crime and punish 
ment. The split was complete; the people was robbed of its old 
pride in its crimes; the great murders had become the quiet game of 
the well behaved.
