&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinance of 1670 regulated the general forms of penal practice 
up to the Revolution. It laid down the following hierarchy of 
penalties: ‘Death, judicial torture pending proof, penal servitude, 
flogging, amende honorable , banishment.’ A high proportion of 
physical punishment. Customs, the nature of the crimes, the status 
of the condemned accounted for still more variations. ‘Capital 
punishment comprises many kinds of death: some prisoners may be 
condemned to be hanged, others to having their hands cut off or 
their tongues cut out or pierced and then to be hanged; others, for 
more serious crimes, to be broken alive and to die on the wheel, 
after having their limbs broken; others to be broken until they die 
a natural death, others to be strangled and then broken, others to 
be burnt alive, others to be burnt after first being strangled; others 
to be drawn by four horses, others to have their heads cut off, and 
others to have their heads broken’ (Soulatges, 169-71). And Sou- 
latges adds, almost in passing, that there are also lighter penalties 
not mentioned by the ordinance: satisfaction to the injured party, 
warning, reprimand, a short period of imprisonment, prohibition 
from entering a certain area and, lastly, pecuniary punishments - 
fines or confiscation. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must not be misled. There was a considerable gap between 
this arsenal of horrors and everyday penal practice. Public torture 
and execution was by no means the most frequent form of punish 
ment. To us today the proportion of death sentences in the penal 
practice of the classical age may seem high: at the Chatelet 1 during 
the period 1755-85 under 10 per cent of the sentences passed in 
volved capital punishment: die wheel, the gallows or the stake 
(Petrovitch, 226ff); the Parlement of Flanders passed thirty-nine 
death sentences, out of a total of 260 sentences, between 1721 and 


1730 (and twenty-six out of 500 between 1781 and 1790 - cf. 
Dautricourt). But it must not be forgotten that :he courts found 
many ways of relaxing the rigours of the penal system, either by 
refusing to prosecute offences that were too heavily punished or by 
modifying the definition of the crime; sometimes too the royal 
power indicated that some particularly severe ordinance was not to 
be applied too strictly (which was how Choiseul dealt with the 
declaration of 3 August 1744 on vagabonds - Choiseul, 128-9). 
In any case, the majority of the sentences involved banishment or 
fines: in a court such as that of the Chatelet (which dealt only with 
relatively serious offences), banishment represented over half the 
sentences passed between 1755 an<1 *785- But man Y these non_ 
corporal penalties were accompanied by additional penalties that 
involved a degree of torture: public exhibition, pillory, carcan, 
flogging, branding; this was the case for all sentences to the ‘galleys’ 
or to what was the equivalent for women - reclusion in the hospital; 
banishment was often preceded by public exhibition and branding; 
fines were sometimes accompanied by flogging. It was not only in 
the great solemn executions, but also in this additional form of 
punishment, that torture revealed the significant part it played in 
penality: every penalty of a certain seriousness had to involve an 
element of torture, of supphee. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a supplied* ‘Corporal punishment, painful to a more or 
less horrible degree,’ said Jaucourt in his Encydopidie article and 
added: ‘It is an inexplicable phenomenon that the extension of 
man’s imagination creates out of the barbarous and the cruel.’ 
Inexplicable, perhaps, but certainly neither irregular nor primitive. 
Torture is a technique; it is not an extreme expression of lawless 
rage. To be torture, punishment must obey three principal criteria: 
first, it must produce a certain degree of pain, which may be meas 
ured exactly, or at least calculated, compared and hierarchized; 
death is a torture in so far as it is not simply a withdrawal of the 
right to live, but is the occasion and the culmination of a calculated 
gradation of pain: from decapitation (which reduces all pain to a 
single gesture, performed in a single moment - the zero degree of 
torture), through hanging, the stake and the wheel (all of which 
prolong the agony), to quartering, which carries pain almost 
to infinity; death-torture is the art of maintaining life in pain, by 
subdividing it into a 'thousand deaths’, by achieving before life 
ceases 'the most exquisite agonies’ (cf. Ollyffe). Torture rests on a 
whole quantitative art of pain. But there is more to it: this production 
of pain is regulated. Torture correlates the type of corporal effect, the 
quality, intensity, duration of pain, with the gravity of the crime, 
the person of the criminal, the rank of his victims. There is a legal 
code of pain; when it involves torture, punishment does not fall 
upon the body indiscriminately or equally; it is calculated according 
to detailed rules: the number of lashes of the whip, the positioning 
of the branding iron, the duration of the death agony on the stake 
or the wheel (the court decides whether the criminal is to be 
strangled at once or allowed to die slowly,, and the points at which 
this gesture of pity must occur), the type of mutilation to be used 
(hand cut off, lips or tongue pierced). All these various elements 
multiply the punishments and are combined according to the court 
and the crime. ‘The poetry of Dante put into laws,’ was how Rossi 
described it; a long course in physico-penal knowledge, in any case. 
Furthermore, torture forms part of a ritual. It is an element in the 
liturgy of punishment and meets two demands. It must mark the 
victim: it is intended, either by the scar it leaves on the body, or by 
the spectacle that accompanies it, to brand the victim with infamy; 
even if its function is to ‘purge’ the crime, torture does not recon 
cile; it traces around or, rather, on the very body of the condemned 
man signs that must not be effaced; in any case, men will remember 
public exhibition, the pillory, torture and pain duly observed. And, 
from the point of view of the law that imposes it, public torture and 
execution must be spectacular, it must be seen by all almost as its 
triumph. The very excess of the violence employed is one of the 
elements of its glory: the fact that the guilty man should moan and 
cry out under the blows is not a shameful side-effect, it is the very 
ceremonial of justice being expressed in all its force. Hence no doubt 
those tortures that take place even after death: corpses burnt, ashes 
thrown to the winds, bodies dragged on hurdles and exhibited at 
the roadside. Justice pursues the body beyond all possible pain. 

The term ‘penal torture’ does not cover any corporal punishment: 
it is a differentiated production of pain, an organized ritual for the 
marking of victims and the expression of the power that punishes; 
not the expression of a legal system driven to exasperation and, 


forgetting its principles, losing all restraint. In the ‘excesses’ of 
torture, a whole economy of power is invested. 

The tortured body is first inscribed in the legal ceremonial that 
must produce, open for all to see, the truth of the crime. 

In France, as in most European countries, with the notable 
exception of England, the entire criminal procedure, right up to the 
sentence, remained secret: that is to say, opaque, not only to the 
public but also to the accused himself. It took place without him, 
or at least without his having any knowledge either of the charges 
or of the evidence. In the order of criminal justice, knowledge was 
the absolute privilege of the prosecution. The preliminary’ investiga 
tion was carried out 'as diligently and secretly as may be’, as the edict 
of 1498 put it. According to the ordinance of 1670, which confirmed 
and, on certain points, reinforced the severity of the preceding 
period, it was impossible for the accused to have access to the docu 
ments of the case, impossible to know the identity of his accusers, 
impossible to know the nature of the evidence before objecting to 
witnesses, impossible to make use, until the last moments of the 
trial, of the documents in proof, impossible to have a lawyer, either 
to ensure the proper conduct of the case, or to take parr, on the 
main issue, in the defence. The magistrate, for his part, had the 
right to accept anonymous denunciations, to conceal from the ac 
cused the nature of the action, to question him with a view to 
catching him out, to use insinuations. (Up to the eighteenth century, 
lengthy arguments took place as to whether, in the course of 
‘captious’ questioning, it was lawful for the judge to use false 
promises, lies, words with double meaning - a whole casuistry of 
legal bad faith.) The magistrate constituted, in solitary omnipotence, 
a truth by which he invested the accused; and the ;udges received 
this truth ready made, in the form of documents and written state 
ments; for them, these factors alone were proof; they met the 
accused only once in order to question him before passing sentence. 
The secret and w'ritten form of the procedure reflects the principle 
that in criminal matters the establishment of truth was the absolute 
right and the exclusive power of die sovereign and his judges. 
Ayrault supposed that this procedure (which was more or less 
established by the sixteenth century) originated in ‘the fear of die 
uproar, shouting and cheering that the people usually indulge in, 
the fear that there would be disorder, violence, and outbursts against 
the parties, or even against the judges’; the king wished to show in 
this that the ‘sovereign power’ from which the right to punish 
derived could in no case belong to the ‘multitude’ (cf. Ayrault, 
LIII, chapters LXXII and LXIX). Before the justice of the sover 
eign, all voices must be still. 

Yet, despite the use of secrecy, certain rules had to be obeyed in 
establishing the truth. Secrecy itself required that a rigorous model 
of penal truth be defined. A whole tradition dating from the Middle 
Ages and considerably developed by the great lawyers of the 
Renaissance laid down what the nature and the use of evidence 
might be. Even in the eighteenth century, it was still common to 
meet distinctions like the following: true, direct, or legitimate proof 
(that provided by witnesses, for example) and indirect, conjectural, 
artificial proof (obtained by argument); or, again, manifest proof, 
considerable proof, imperfect or slight (Jousse, 660); or, again, 
‘urgent or necessary’ proof that did not allow one to doubt the 
truth of the deed (this was 'lull' proof: thus two irreproachable wit 
nesses affirming that they saw die accused, carrying an unsheathed 
and bloody sword, leave the place where, some time later, the body 
of the dead man was found with stab wounds); approximate or semi 
full proof, which may be regarded as true as long as the accused does 
not destroy it with evidence to the contrary (die evidence of a single 
eye-witness or deadi threats preceding a murder); lastly, distant or 
‘ adminicule ’ clues, which consisted only of opinion (rumour, the 
flight of the suspect, his manner when questioned, etc. - Muyart de 
Vouglans, 1757, 345-7)- Now, these distinctions are not simply 
theoretical subtleties. They have an operational function. First, 
because each of these kinds of evidence, taken in isolation, may have 
a particular type of judicial effect: ‘full’ proof may lead to any 
sentence; ‘semi-full’ proof may lead to any of the ‘peines afflictives', 
or heavy penalties, except death; imperfect and slight clues are 
enough for the suspect to have a writ issued against him, to have 
the case deferred for further inquiry or to have a fine imposed on 
him. Secondly, because they are combined according to precise 
arithmetical rules: two ‘semi-full’ proofs may make a complete proof; 
‘ adminicules ', providing there are several of them and they concur, 

may be combined to form a semi-proof; but, however many there 
may be of them, they can never, of themselves, constitute a complete 
proof. Wc have, then, a penal arithmetic that is meticulous on many 
points, but which still leaves a margin for a good deal of argument: in 
order for a capital sentence to be passed, is a single full proof enough 
or must it be accompanied by other slighter clues? Are two approxi 
mate proofs always equivalent to a full proof? Should not three be 
required or two plus distant clues? Are there elements that may be 
regarded as clues only for certain crimes, in certain circumstances 
and in relation to certain persons (thus evidence is disregarded if it 
comes from a vagabond; it is reinforced, on the contrary, if it is 
provided by ‘a considerable person’ or by a master in the case of a 
domestic offence). It is an arithmetic modulated by casuistry, whose 
function is to define how a legal proof is to be constructed. On the 
one hand, this system of ‘legal proofs’ makes truth in the penal 
domain the result of a complex art; it obeys rules known only to 
specialists, and, consequently, it reinforces the principle of secrecy. 
‘It is not enough that the judge should have the conviction that any 
reasonable man may have. . . Nothing is more incorrect than this 
way of judging, which, in truth, is no other than a more or less well- 

( founded opinion.’ But, on the other hand, it is a severe constraint 
for the magistrate; in the absence of this regularity, ‘every sentence 
would be reckless, and in a sense it may be said that it is unjust even 
when, in truth, the accused is guilty’ (Poullain du Parc, 112-13 - see 
also Esmein, 260-83 and Mittermaier, 15—19). The day will come 
when the singularity of this judicial truth will appear scandalous: 
as if the law did not have to obey the rules of common truth. ‘What 
would be said of a semi-proof in the sciences capable of demonstra 
tion? What would a geometrical or algebraic semi-proof amount 
to?’ (Seigneux de Correvon, 63). But it should not be forgotten 
that these formal constraints on legal proof were a mode of regula 
tion internal to absolute power and exclusive of knowledge. 
## Start
Written, secret, subjected, in order to construct its proofs, to 
rigorous rules, the penal investigation was a machine that might 
produce the truth in the absence of the accused. And by this very 
fact, though the law strictly speaking did not require it, this pro 
cedure was to tend necessarily to the confession. And for two 
reasons: first, because the confession constituted so strong a proof 
that there was scarcely any need to add others, or to enter the diffi 
cult and dubious combinatory of clues; the confession, provided it 
was obtained in the correct manner, almost discharged the prosecu 
tion of the obligation to provide further evidence (in any case, the 
most difficult evidence). Secondly, the only way that this procedure 
might use all its unequivocal authority, and become a real victory 
over the accused, the only way in which the truth might exert all its 
power, w ( as for the criminal to accept responsibility for his own 
crime and himself sign what had been skilfully and obscurely 
constructed by the preliminary investigation. ‘It is not enough’, as 
Ayrault, w-ho did not care for these secret procedures, remarked, 
‘that wrong-doers be justly punished. They must if possible judge 
and condemn themselves’ (Ayrault, i. I, chapter 14). Within the 
crime reconstituted by writing, the criminal who confessed came to 
play the role of living truth. The confession, an act of the criminal, 
responsible and speaking subject, was the complement to the written, 
secret preliminary investigation. Hence the importance that all this 
procedure of an inquisitorial type accorded to the confession. 

IIem.c, iuu, rhe: ambiguities of its role. On the one hand, an 
attempt was made to introduce it into the general arithmetic of 
evidence; it was stressed that it was no more than one proof among 
many. It was not the evidentia rei; nor was it the strongest of the 
proofs, it was not in itself enough to bring conviction, it had to be 
accompanied by additional, circumstantial evidence; for it is a well- 
known fact that the accused sometimes declare themselves to be 
guilty of crimes that they have not committed; the examining magis 
trate had therefore to carry out additional investigations if he 
possessed no more than the confession of the accused. But, on the 
other hand, the confession had priority over any other kind of 
evidence. To a certain extent, it transcended all other evidence; an 
element in the calculation of the truth, it was also the act by which 
the accused accepted the charge and recognized its truth; it trans 
formed an investigation carried out without him into a voluntary 
affirmation. Through the confession, the accused himself took part 
in tile ritual of producing penal truth. As medieval law put it, the 
confession ‘renders the thing notorious and manifest’. To this first 
ambiguity was added a second: as a particularly strong proof, 
requiring for a conviction only a few additional clues, thus reducing 
to the minimum the work of investigation and the mechanics of 
demonstration, the confession was therefore highly valued; every 
possible coercion -would be used to obtain it. But, although it had 
to be, in the procedure, the living and oral counterpart of the 
written preliminary investigation, although it had to be its reply, 
its authentication, as it were, on the part of the accused, it had to be 
surrounded by guarantees and formalities. It preserved something 
of a transaction: that is why it had to be ‘spontaneous’, why it had 
to be formulated before the competent court, why it had to be made 
in full consciousness, why it should not concern impossible things, 
etc. 2 Through the confession, the accused committed himself to the 
procedure; he signed the truth of the preliminary' investigation. 

## Section 

This double ambiguity of the confession (an element of proof and 
the counterpart of preliminary investigation; the effect of constraint 
and a semi-voluntary transaction) explains the two great means used 
by classical criminal law to obtain it: the oath that the accused was 
asked to make before his interrogatory (and therefore under threat 
of perjury before both human and divine justice; and, at the same 
time, a ritual act of commitment); judicial torture (physical violence 
to obtain truth, which, in any case, had then to be repeated before 
the judges, as a ‘spontaneous’ confession, if it were to constitute 
proof). At the end of the eighteenth century, torture was to be 
denounced as a survival of the barbarities of another age: the mark 
of a savagery that was denounced as ‘Gothic’. It is true that the 
practice of torture is of ancient origin: it goes back at least as far 
as the Inquisition, of course, and probably to the torture of slaves. 
But it did not figure in classical law as a survival or defect. It occu 
pied a strict place in a complex penal mechanism, in which the 
procedure of an inquisitorial type was reinforced with elements of 
the accusatory system; in which the written demonstration required 
an oral correlative; in which the techniques of proof administered 
by the magistrates were mingled with the methods of the ordeal to 
which the accused was challenged; in which he was called upon - if 
necessary by the most violent persuasion - to play the role of 
voluntary partner in the procedure; in which it w r as a question, in 
short, of producing truth by a mechanism consisting of tw'o ele 
ments - that of the investigation carried out in secret by the judicial 
authority and that of the act ritually performed by the accused. The 
body of the accused, the speaking and, if necessary, suffering body, 
assured the interlocking of these two mechanisms; that is why, 
until the classical system of punishment was re-examined from top 
to bottom, there were so few radical criticisms of torture (the most 
famous being Nicolas’s Si la torture est un moyen a verifier Us crimes 
of 1682). Much more frequent were simple recommendations of 
prudence: ‘Judicial torture is a dangerous means of arriving at 
knowledge of the truth; that is why judges must not resort to it with 
out due consideration. Nothing is more equivocal. There are guilty 
men who have enough firmness to hide a true crime... and innocent 
victims who are made to confess crimes of which they were not 
guilty' (Ferriere, 612). 
##Section
On this basis one may see the functioning of judicial torture, or 
interrogation under torture, as a torture of the truth. To begin with, 
judicial torture was not a way of obtaining the truth at all costs; it 
was not the unrestrained torture of modern interrogations; it was 
certainly cruel, but it was not savage. It was a regulated practice, 
obeying a well-defined procedure; the various stages, their duration, 
the instruments used, the length of ropes and the heaviness of the 
weights used, the number of interventions made by the interrogating 
magistrate, all this was, according to the different local practices, 
carefully codified (In 1729, Aguesseau ordered an investigation into 
the means and rules of torture used in France. For a summary of the 
findings, cf. Joly de Fleurv, 322-8.) Torture was a strict judicial 
game. And, as such, it was linked to the old tests or trials - ordeals, 
judicial duels, judgements of God - that were practised in accusatory 
procedures long before the techniques of the Inquisition. Something 
of the joust survived, between the judge who ordered the judicial 
torture and the suspect who was tortured; the ‘patient’ - this is the 
term used to designate the victim - was subjected to a series of trials, 
graduated in severity, in which he succeeded if he ‘held out’, or 
failed if he confessed. (The first degree of torture was the sight of 
the instruments. In the case of children or of persons over the age 
of seventy, one did not go beyond this stage.) But the examining 
magistrate did not employ torture without himself taking certain 
risks (apart, that is, from the danger of causing the suspect’s death); 
he had a stake in the game, namely, the evidence that he had already 
collected; for the rule was that if the accused ‘held out’ and did not 


confess, the magistrate was forced to drop the charges. The tortured 
man had then won. Hence the custom, which had been introduced 
for the most serious cases, of imposing judicial torture ‘pending 
prooF: in this case the magistrate could continue with his investiga 
tion after the torture had failed; the suspect was not declared 
innocent by his resistance; but at least his victory sived him from 
being condemned to death. The judge kept all his cards, except the 
principal one. Omnia citra mortem. Hence the recommendation 
often made to magistrates, in the case of the most serious crimes, 
not to subject to judicial torture a suspect against whom the evidence 
was sufficiently convincing for, if he managed to resist the torture, 
the magistrate would no longer have the right to pass the death 
sentence, which he nevertheless deserved; in such a joust, justice 
would be the loser: if the evidence was sufficient ‘to condemn such a 
guilty person to death’, one should not ‘leave the conviction to 
chance and to the outcome of a provisional interrogation that often 
leads to nothing; for it is in the interest of public safety to make 
examples of grave, horrible and capital crimes’ (Rousseaud de la 
Combe, 503). 

Beneath an apparently determined, impatient search for truth, 
one finds in classical torture the regulated mechanism of an ordeal: 
a physical challenge that must define the truth; if the patient is 
guilty, the pains that it imposes are not unjust; but it is also a mark 
of exculpation if he is innocent. In the practice of torture, pain, 
confrontation and truth were bound together: they worked to 
gether on the patient’s body. The search for truth through judicial 
torture was certainly a way of obtaining evidence, the most serious 
of all - the confession of the guilty person; but it was also the battle, 
and this victory of one adversary over the other, that ‘produced’ 
truth according to a ritual. In torture employed to extract a con 
fession, there was an element of the investigation; there also was an 
element of the duel. 

It is as if investigation and punishment had become mixed. And 
this is not the least paradoxical thing about it. Judicial torture was 
indeed defined as a way of complementing the demonstration when 
‘there are not sufficient penalties in the trial’. For it was included 
among the penalties; it was a penalty so grave that, in the hierarchy 
of punishments, the ordinance of 1760 placed it immediately after 
death. How can a penalty be used as a means? one was later to ask. 
How can one treat as a punishment what ought to be a method of 
demonstration? The reason is to be found in the way in which 
criminal justice, in the classical period, operated the production of 
truth. The different pieces of evidence did not constitute so many 
neutral elements, until such time as they could be gathered together 
into a single body of evidence that would bring the final certainty 
ol guilt. Each piece of evidence aroused a particular degree of 
abomination. Guilt did not begin when all the evidence was gathered 
together; piece by piece, it was constituted by each of the elements 
that made it possible to recognize a guilty person. Thus a semi 
proof did not leave the suspect innocent until such time as it was 
completed; it made him semi-guilty; slight evidence of a serious 
crime marked someone as slightly criminal. In short, penal demon 
stration did not obey a dualistic system: true or false; but a 
principle of continuous gradation; a degree reached in the demon 
stration already formed a degree of guilt and consequently involved 
a degree of punishment. The suspect, as such, always deserved a 
certain punishment; one could not be the object of suspicion and be 
completely innocent. Suspicion implied an element of demonstration 
as regards the judge, the mark of a certain degree of guilt as regards 
the suspect and a limited form of penalty as regards punishment. A 
suspect, who remained a suspect, was not for all that declared inno 
cent, but was partially punished. When one reached a certain degree 
ol presumption, one could then legitimately bring into play a 
practice that had a dual role: to begin the punishment in pursuance 
of the information already collected and to make use of this first 
stage of punishment in order to extort the truth that was still miss 
ing. In the eighteenth century, judicial torture functioned in that 
strange economy in which the ritual that produced the truth went 
side by side with the ritual that imposed the punishment. The body 
interrogated in torture constituted the point of application of the 
punishment and the locus of extortion of the truth. And just as 
presumption was inseparably an element in the investigation and a 
fragment of guilt, the regulated pain involved in judicial torture 
was a means both of punishment and of investigation. 

Now, curiously enough, this interlocking of the two rituals 


through the body continued, evidence having been confirmed and 
sentence passed, in the actual carrying out of the penalty; and the 
body of the condemned man was once again an essential element in 
the ceremonial of public punishment. It was the task of the guilty 
man to bear openly his condemnation and the truth of the crime 
that he had committed. His body, displayed, exhibited in procession, 
tortured, served as the public support of a procedure that had 
hitherto remained in the shade; in him, on him, the sentence had to 
be legible for all. This immediate, striking manifestation of the 
truth in the public implementation of penalties assumed, in the 
eighteenth century, several aspects. 

1. It made the guilty man the herald of his own condemnation. 
He was given the task, in a sense, of proclaiming it and thus attesting 
to the truth of what he had been charged with: the procession 
through the streets, the placard attached to his back, chest or head 
as a reminder of the sentence; the halts at various crossroads, the 
reading of the sentence, the amende honorable performed at the doors 
of churches, in which the condemned man solemnly acknowledged 
his crime: 'Barefoot, wearing a shirt, carrying a torch, kneeling, to 
say and to declare that wickedly, horribly, treacherously, he has 
committed the most detestable crime, etc.'; exhibition at a stake 
where his deeds and the sentence were read out; yet another reading 
of the sentence at the foot of the scaffold; whether he was to go 
simply to the pillory or to the stake and the wheel, the condemned 
man published his crime and the justice that had been meted out to 
him by bearing them physically on his body. 

a. It took up once again the scene of the confession. It dupli 
cated the forced proclamation of the amende honorable with a 
spontaneous, public acknowledgement. It established the public 
execution as the moment of truth. These last moments, when the 
guilty man no longer has anything to lose, arc won for the full light 
of truth. After the passing of the sentence, the court could decide 
on same new torture to obtain the names of possible accomplices. 
It was also recognized that at the very moment he mounted the 
scaffold the condemned man could ask for a respite in order to make 
new revelations. The public expected this new turn in the course of 
truth. Many made use of it in order to gain time, as did Michel 
Barbier, found guilty of armed assault: 'He stared impudently at the 
scaffold and said that it had certainly not been set up for him, since 
he was innocent; he first asked to return to the chamber, where he 
beat about the bush for half an hour, still trying to justify himself; 
then, when he was sent back to execution, he ascended the scaffold 
with a purposeful air, but, when he saw himself undressed and tied 
to the cross before being stretched, he asked to go back to the 
chamber a second time and there made a full confession of his 
crimes and even declared that he was guilty of another murder’ 
(Hardy, IV, 80). The function of the public torture and execution 
was to reveal the truth; and in this respect it continued, in the public 
eye, the work of the judicial torture conducted in private. It added 
to the conviction the signature of the convicted man. A successful 
public execution justified justice, in that it published the truth of the 
crime in the very body of the man to be executed. An example of the 
good condemned man was Francois Billiard, a senior postal official, 
who murdered his wife in 1772. The executioner wanted to hide 
his face to spare him the insults of the crowd: ‘ “This punishment, 
which I have merited, has not been inflicted upon me," he said, "so 
that I should not be seen by the public. . He was still wearing 
mourning dress in honour of his wife. . . He was wearing new 
shoes, his hair had been recently curled and powdered, and he had a 
countenance so modest and so dignified that those present who 
found themselves observing him more closely said that he must be 
the most perfect Christian or the greatest of all hypocrites. The 
placard that he was wearing on his chest had gone askew, and it was 
noticed that he had straightened it himself, no doubt so that people 
could read it the more easily' (Hardy, I, 327). If each of the partici 
pants played his role well, the penal ceremony had the effectiveness 
of a long public confession. 

3. It pinned the public torture on to the crime itself; it established 
from one to the other a series of decipherable relations. It was an 
exhibition of the corpse of the condemned man at the scene of his 
crime, or at one of the near-by crossroads. The execution was often 
carried out at the very place where the crime had been committed - 
as in the case of the student who, in 1723, had killed several persons 
and for whom the presidial court of Nantes decided to set up a 
scaffold in front of the inn where he had committed his murders 
(Nantes, F.F. 124; cf. Parfouru, XXV). There was the use of 
'symbolic' torture in which the forms of the execution referred to 
the nature of the crime: the tongues of blasphemers were pierced, the 
impure were burnt, the right hand of murderers was cut off; some 
times the condemned man was made to carry the instrument of his 
crime - thus Damiens was made to hold in his guilty right hand the 
famous dagger with which he had committed the crime, hand and 
dagger being smeared with sulphur and burnt together. As Vico 
remarked, this old jurisprudence was ‘an entire poetics’. 

There were even some cases of an almost theatrical reproduction 
of the crime in the execution of the guilty man - with the same 
instruments, the same gestures. Thus justice had the crime re 
enacted before the eyes of all, publishing it in its truth and at the 
same time annulling it in the death of the guilty man. Even as late 
in the eighteenth century as 1772, one finds sentences like the follow 
ing: a servant girl at Cambrai, having killed her mistress, was con 
demned to be taken to the place of her execution in a cart 'used to 
collect rubbish at the crossroads'; there a gibbet was to be set up 
‘at the foot of which will be placed the same chair in which the said 
I jleu, her mistress, was sitting at the time of the murder; and having 

( seated the criminal there, the executioner of the High Court of 
Justice will cut off her right hand, throw it in her presence into the 
fire, and, immediately afterwards, will strike her four blows with 
the cleaver with which she murdered the said Laleu, the first and 
second being on the head, the third on the left forearm and the 
fourth on the chest; this done, she will be hung and strangled on the 
said gibbet until she be dead; and when two hours have elapsed her 
dead body will be removed and the head separated from it at the 
foot of the said gibbet on the said scaffold, with the same cleaver 

( she used to murder her mistress, and the same head exhibited 
on a pole twenty feet high outside the gates of the said Cambrai, 
within reach of the road that leads to Douai, and the rest of the body 
put in a sack, and buried near the said pole at a depth of ten feet’ 
(quoted in Dautricourt, 269-70). 

4. Lastly, the slowness of the process of torture and execution, 
its sudden dramatic moments, the cries and sufferings of the con 
demned man serve as an ultimate proof at the end of the judicial 
ritual. Every death agony expresses a certain truth: but, when it 
takes place on the scaffold, it does so with more intensity, in that it 
is hastened by pain; with more rigour, because it occurs exactly at 
the juncture between the judgement of men and the judgement of 
God; with more ostentation, because it takes place in public. The 
sufferings of the condemned man are an extension of those of the 
judicial torture that precedes them; in the judicial torture, however, 
the game was not yet over and one could still save one’s life; now 
one will die, without any doubt, and it is one's soul that one must 
save. The eternal game has already begun: the torture of the execu 
tion anticipates the punishments of the beyond; it shows what they 
are; it is the theatre of hell; the cries of the condemned man, his 
struggles, his blasphemies, already signify his irremediable destiny. 
But the pains here below may also be counted as penitence and so 
alleviate the punishments of the beyond: God will not fail to take 
such a martyrdom into account, providing it is borne with resigna 
tion. The cruelty of the earthly punishment will be deducted from 
the punishment to come: in it is glimpsed the promise of forgive 
ness. But, it might be said, arc not such terrible sufferings a sign 
that God has abandoned the guilty man to the mercy of his fellow 
creatures? And, far from securing future absolution, do they not 
prefigure imminent damnation; so that, if the condemned man dies 
quickly, without a prolonged agony, is it not proof that God wishes 
to protect him and to prevent him from falling into despair? There 
is, therefore, an ambiguity in this suffering that may signify equally 
well the truth of the crime or the error of the judges, the goodness 
or the evil of the criminal, the coincidence or the divergence between 
the judgement of men and that of God. Hence the insatiable curiosity 
that drove the spectators to the scaffold to witness the spectacle of 
sufferings truly endured; there one could decipher crime and inno 
cence, the past and the future, the here below and the eternal. It was 
a moment of truth that all the spectators questioned: each word, each 
cry, the duration of the agony, the resisting body, the life that clung 
desperately to it, all this constituted a sign. There was the man who 
survived 'six hours on the wheel, and did not want the executioner, 
who consoled and heartened him no doubt as best he could, to leave 
him for a moment’; there was the man who died ‘with true Christian 
feeling, and who manifested the most sincere repentance’; the man 
who 'expired on the wheel an hour after being put there; it is said 
that the spectators of his torture were moved by the outward signs
of religion and repentance that he gave’; the man who had shown 
the most marked signs of contrition throughout the journey to the 
scaffold, but who, when placed alive on the wheel, ‘did not cease 
to let forth the most horrible cries'; or again the woman who ‘had 
preserved her calm up to the moment when the sentence was read, 
bui whose wits then began to turn; she was quite mad by the time 
she was hanged’ (Hardy, I, 13; IV, 42; V, 134). 

We have come full circle: from the judicial torture to the execu 
tion, the body has produced and reproduced the truth of the crime 
-or rather it constitutes the element which, through a whole set of 
rituals and trials, confesses that the crime took place, admits that the 
accused did indeed commit it, shows that he bore it inscribed in 
himself and on himself, supports the operation of punishment and 
manifests its effects in the most striking way. The body, several 
times tortured, provides the synthesis of the reality of the deeds and 
the truth of the investigation, of the documents of the case and the 
statements of the criminal, of the crime and the punishment. It is an 
essential element, therefore, in a penal liturgy, in which it must 
serve as the partner of a procedure ordered around the formidable 
rights of the sovereign, the prosecution and secrecy. 

The public execution is to be understood not only as a judicial, 
but also as a political ritual. It belongs, even in minor cases, to the 
ceremonies by which power is manifested. 

An offence, according to the law of the classical age, quite apart 
from the damage it may produce, apart even from the rule that it 
breaks, offends the rectitude of those who abide by the law: 'If one 
commits something that the law forbids, even if there is neither harm 
nor injury to the individual, it is an offence that demands reparation, 
because the right of the superior man is violated and because it 
offends the dignity of his character’ (Risi, 9). Besides its immediate 
victim, the crime attacks the sovereign: it attacks him personally, 
once the law represents the will of the sovereign; it attacks him 
physically, since the force of the law is the force of the prince. 
’For a law to be in force in this kingdom, it must necessarily have 
emanated directly from the sovereign, or at least been confirmed by 
the seal of his authority’ (Muyart de Vouglans, xxxiv). The inter 
vention of the sovereign is not, therefore, an arbitration between 
two adversaries; it is much more, even, than an action to enforce 
respect for the rights of the individual; it is a direct reply to the 
person who has offended him. There can be no doubt that ‘the 
exercise of the sovereign power in the punishment of crime is one 
of the essential parts of the administration of justice’ (Jousse, vii). 
Punishment, therefore, cannot be identified with or even measured 
by the redress of the injury; in punishment, there must always be a 
portion that belongs to the prince, and, even when it is combined 
with the redress laid down, it constitutes the most important clement 
in the penal liquidation of the crime. Now, this portion belonging 
to the prince is not in itself simple: on the one hand, it requires 
redress for the injury that has been done to his kingdom (as an 
element of disorder and as an example given to others, this con¬ 
siderable injury is out of all proportion to that which has been 
committed upon a private individual); but it also requires that the 
king take revenge for an affront to his very person.

The right to punish, therefore, is an aspect of the sovereign’s 
right to make war on his enemies: to punish belongs to 'that 
absolute power of life and death which Roman law calls merum 
imperium , a right by virtue of which the prince sees that his law is 
respected by ordering the punishment of crime’ (Muyart de Vou- 
glans, xxxiv). But punishment is also a way of exacting retribution 
that is both personal and public, since the physico-political force 
of the sovereign is in a sense present in the law: ’One secs by the 
very definition of the law that it tends not only to prohibit, but also 
to avenge contempt for its authority by the punishment of those who 
violate its prohibitions’ (Muyart de Vouglans, xxxiv). In the execu¬ 
tion of the most ordinary penalty, in the most punctilious respect of 
legal forms, reign the active forces of revenge. 

The public execution, then, has a juridico-political function. It is 
a ceremonial by which a momentarily injured sovereignty is recon¬ 
stituted. It restores that sovereignty by manifesting it at its most 
spectacular. The public execution, however hasty and everyday, 
belongs to a whole scries of great rituals in which power is eclipsed 
and restored (coronation, entry of the king into a conquered city, 
the submission of rebellious subjects); over and above the crime 
that has placed the sovereign in contempt, it deploys before all eyes 
an invincible force. Its aim is not so much to re-establish a balance
as to bring into play, as its extreme point, the dissymmetry between 
the subject who has dared to violate the law and the all-powerful 
sovereign who displays his strength. Although redress of the private 
injury occasioned by the offence must be proportionate, although the 
sentence must be equitable, the punishment is carried out in such a 
way as to give a spectacle not of measure, but of imbalance and 
excess; in this liturgy of punishment, there must be an emphatic 
affirmation of power and of its intrinsic superiority. And this superi¬ 
ority is not simply that of right, but that of the physical strength 
of the sovereign beating down upon the body of his adversary and 
mastering it: by breaking the law, the offender has touched the very 
person of the prince; and it is the prince - or at least those to whom 
he has delegated his force - who seizes upon the body of the con¬ 
demned man and displays it marked, beaten, broken. The ceremony 
of punishment, then, is an exercise of ‘terror’. When the jurists of 
the eighteenth century began their polemic with the reformers, they 
offered a restrictive, ‘modernist' interpretation of the physical 
cruelty of the penalties imposed by the law: if severe penalties are 
required, it is because their example must be deeply inscribed in the 
hearts of men. Yet, in fact, what had hitherto maintained this 
practice of torture was not an economy of example, in the sense in 
which it was to be understood at the time of the idtologucs (that the 
representation of the penalty should be greater than the interest of 
the crime), but a policy of terror: to make everyone aware, through 
the body of the criminal, of the unrestrained presence of the sover¬ 
eign. The public execution did not re-establish justice; it reactivated 
power. In the seventeenth century, and even in the early eighteenth 
century, it was not, therefore, with all its theatre of terror, a linger¬ 
ing hang-over from an earlier age. Its ruthlessncss, its spectacle, its 
physical violence, its unbalanced play of forces, its meticulous 
ceremonial, its entire apparatus were inscribed in the political 
functioning of the penal system.
