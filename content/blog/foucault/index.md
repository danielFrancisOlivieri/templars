&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinance of 1670 regulated the general forms of penal practice 
up to the Revolution. It laid down the following hierarchy of 
penalties: ‘Death, judicial torture pending proof, penal servitude, 
flogging, amende honorable , banishment.’ A high proportion of 
physical punishment. Customs, the nature of the crimes, the status 
of the condemned accounted for still more variations. ‘Capital 
punishment comprises many kinds of death: some prisoners may be 
condemned to be hanged, others to having their hands cut off or 
their tongues cut out or pierced and then to be hanged; others, for 
more serious crimes, to be broken alive and to die on the wheel, 
after having their limbs broken; others to be broken until they die 
a natural death, others to be strangled and then broken, others to 
be burnt alive, others to be burnt after first being strangled; others 
to be drawn by four horses, others to have their heads cut off, and 
others to have their heads broken’ (Soulatges, 169-71). And Sou- 
latges adds, almost in passing, that there are also lighter penalties 
not mentioned by the ordinance: satisfaction to the injured party, 
warning, reprimand, a short period of imprisonment, prohibition 
from entering a certain area and, lastly, pecuniary punishments - 
fines or confiscation. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must not be misled. There was a considerable gap between 
this arsenal of horrors and everyday penal practice. Public torture 
and execution was by no means the most frequent form of punish¬ 
ment. To us today the proportion of death sentences in the penal 
practice of the classical age may seem high: at the Chatelet 1 during 
the period 1755-85 under 10 per cent of the sentences passed in¬ 
volved capital punishment: die wheel, the gallows or the stake 
(Petrovitch, 226ff); the Parlement of Flanders passed thirty-nine 
death sentences, out of a total of 260 sentences, between 1721 and 


1730 (and twenty-six out of 500 between 1781 and 1790 - cf. 
Dautricourt). But it must not be forgotten that :he courts found 
many ways of relaxing the rigours of the penal system, either by 
refusing to prosecute offences that were too heavily punished or by 
modifying the definition of the crime; sometimes too the royal 
power indicated that some particularly severe ordinance was not to 
be applied too strictly (which was how Choiseul dealt with the 
declaration of 3 August 1744 on vagabonds - Choiseul, 128-9). 
In any case, the majority of the sentences involved banishment or 
fines: in a court such as that of the Chatelet (which dealt only with 
relatively serious offences), banishment represented over half the 
sentences passed between 1755 an<1 *785- But man Y these non_ 
corporal penalties were accompanied by additional penalties that 
involved a degree of torture: public exhibition, pillory, carcan, 
flogging, branding; this was the case for all sentences to the ‘galleys’ 
or to what was the equivalent for women - reclusion in the hospital; 
banishment was often preceded by public exhibition and branding; 
fines were sometimes accompanied by flogging. It was not only in 
the great solemn executions, but also in this additional form of 
punishment, that torture revealed the significant part it played in 
penality: every penalty of a certain seriousness had to involve an 
element of torture, of supphee. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a supplied* ‘Corporal punishment, painful to a more or 
less horrible degree,’ said Jaucourt in his Encydopidie article and 
added: ‘It is an inexplicable phenomenon that the extension of 
man’s imagination creates out of the barbarous and the cruel.’ 
Inexplicable, perhaps, but certainly neither irregular nor primitive. 
Torture is a technique; it is not an extreme expression of lawless 
rage. To be torture, punishment must obey three principal criteria: 
first, it must produce a certain degree of pain, which may be meas¬ 
ured exactly, or at least calculated, compared and hierarchized; 
death is a torture in so far as it is not simply a withdrawal of the 
right to live, but is the occasion and the culmination of a calculated 
gradation of pain: from decapitation (which reduces all pain to a 
single gesture, performed in a single moment - the zero degree of 
torture), through hanging, the stake and the wheel (all of which 
prolong the agony), to quartering, which carries pain almost 
to infinity; death-torture is the art of maintaining life in pain, by 
subdividing it into a 'thousand deaths’, by achieving before life 
ceases 'the most exquisite agonies’ (cf. Ollyffe). Torture rests on a 
whole quantitative art of pain. But there is more to it: this production 
of pain is regulated. Torture correlates the type of corporal effect, the 
quality, intensity, duration of pain, with the gravity of the crime, 
the person of the criminal, the rank of his victims. There is a legal 
code of pain; when it involves torture, punishment does not fall 
upon the body indiscriminately or equally; it is calculated according 
to detailed rules: the number of lashes of the whip, the positioning 
of the branding iron, the duration of the death agony on the stake 
or the wheel (the court decides whether the criminal is to be 
strangled at once or allowed to die slowly,, and the points at which 
this gesture of pity must occur), the type of mutilation to be used 
(hand cut off, lips or tongue pierced). All these various elements 
multiply the punishments and are combined according to the court 
and the crime. ‘The poetry of Dante put into laws,’ was how Rossi 
described it; a long course in physico-penal knowledge, in any case. 
Furthermore, torture forms part of a ritual. It is an element in the 
liturgy of punishment and meets two demands. It must mark the 
victim: it is intended, either by the scar it leaves on the body, or by 
the spectacle that accompanies it, to brand the victim with infamy; 
even if its function is to ‘purge’ the crime, torture does not recon¬ 
cile; it traces around or, rather, on the very body of the condemned 
man signs that must not be effaced; in any case, men will remember 
public exhibition, the pillory, torture and pain duly observed. And, 
from the point of view of the law that imposes it, public torture and 
execution must be spectacular, it must be seen by all almost as its 
triumph. The very excess of the violence employed is one of the 
elements of its glory: the fact that the guilty man should moan and 
cry out under the blows is not a shameful side-effect, it is the very 
ceremonial of justice being expressed in all its force. Hence no doubt 
those tortures that take place even after death: corpses burnt, ashes 
thrown to the winds, bodies dragged on hurdles and exhibited at 
the roadside. Justice pursues the body beyond all possible pain. 

The term ‘penal torture’ does not cover any corporal punishment: 
it is a differentiated production of pain, an organized ritual for the 
marking of victims and the expression of the power that punishes; 
not the expression of a legal system driven to exasperation and, 


forgetting its principles, losing all restraint. In the ‘excesses’ of 
torture, a whole economy of power is invested. 

The tortured body is first inscribed in the legal ceremonial that 
must produce, open for all to see, the truth of the ctime. 

In France, as in most European countries, with the notable 
exception of England, the entire criminal procedure, right up to the 
sentence, remained secret: that is to say, opaque, not only to the 
public but also to the accused himself. It took place without him, 
or at least without his having any knowledge either of the charges 
or of the evidence. In the order of criminal justice, knowledge was 
the absolute privilege of the prosecution. The preliminary’ investiga¬ 
tion was carried out 'as diligently and secretly as may be’, as the edict 
of 1498 put it. According to the ordinance of 1670, which confirmed 
and, on certain points, reinforced the severity of the preceding 
period, it was impossible for the accused to have access to the docu¬ 
ments of the case, impossible to know the identity of his accusers, 
impossible to know the nature of the evidence before objecting to 
witnesses, impossible to make use, until the last moments of the 
trial, of the documents in proof, impossible to have a lawyer, either 
to ensure the proper conduct of the case, or to take parr, on the 
main issue, in the defence. The magistrate, for his part, had the 
right to accept anonymous denunciations, to conceal from the ac¬ 
cused the nature of the action, to question him with a view to 
catching him out, to use insinuations. (Up to the eighteenth century, 
lengthy arguments took place as to whether, in the course of 
‘captious’ questioning, it was lawful for the judge to use false 
promises, lies, words with double meaning - a whole casuistry of 
legal bad faith.) The magistrate constituted, in solitary omnipotence, 
a truth by which he invested the accused; and the ;udges received 
this truth ready made, in the form of documents and written state¬ 
ments; for them, these factors alone were proof; they met the 
accused only once in order to question him before passing sentence. 
The secret and w'ritten form of the procedure reflects the principle 
that in criminal matters the establishment of truth was the absolute 
right and the exclusive power of die sovereign and his judges. 
Ayrault supposed that this procedure (which was more or less 
established by the sixteenth century) originated in ‘the fear of die 
uproar, shouting and cheering that the people usually indulge in, 
the fear that there would be disorder, violence, and outbursts against 
the parties, or even against the judges’; the king wished to show in 
this that the ‘sovereign power’ from which the right to punish 
derived could in no case belong to the ‘multitude’ (cf. Ayrault, 
LIII, chapters LXXII and LXIX). Before the justice of the sover¬ 
eign, all voices must be still. 

Yet, despite the use of secrecy, certain rules had to be obeyed in 
establishing the truth. Secrecy itself required that a rigorous model 
of penal truth be defined. A whole tradition dating from the Middle 
Ages and considerably developed by the great lawyers of the 
Renaissance laid down what the nature and the use of evidence 
might be. Even in the eighteenth century, it was still common to 
meet distinctions like the following: true, direct, or legitimate proof 
(that provided by witnesses, for example) and indirect, conjectural, 
artificial proof (obtained by argument); or, again, manifest proof, 
considerable proof, imperfect or slight (Jousse, 660); or, again, 
‘urgent or necessary’ proof that did not allow one to doubt the 
truth of the deed (this was 'lull' proof: thus two irreproachable wit¬ 
nesses affirming that they saw die accused, carrying an unsheathed 
and bloody sword, leave the place where, some time later, the body 
of the dead man was found with stab wounds); approximate or semi¬ 
full proof, which may be regarded as true as long as the accused does 
not destroy it with evidence to the contrary (die evidence of a single 
eye-witness or deadi threats preceding a murder); lastly, distant or 
‘ adminicule ’ clues, which consisted only of opinion (rumour, the 
flight of the suspect, his manner when questioned, etc. - Muyart de 
Vouglans, 1757, 345-7)- Now, these distinctions are not simply 
theoretical subtleties. They have an operational function. First, 
because each of these kinds of evidence, taken in isolation, may have 
a particular type of judicial effect: ‘full’ proof may lead to any 
sentence; ‘semi-full’ proof may lead to any of the ‘peines afflictives', 
or heavy penalties, except death; imperfect and slight clues are 
enough for the suspect to have a writ issued against him, to have 
the case deferred for further inquiry or to have a fine imposed on 
him. Secondly, because they are combined according to precise 
arithmetical rules: two ‘semi-full’ proofs may make a complete proof; 
‘ adminicules ', providing there are several of them and they concur, 

may be combined to form a semi-proof; but, however many there 
may be of them, they can never, of themselves, constitute a complete 
proof. Wc have, then, a penal arithmetic that is meticulous on many 
points, but which still leaves a margin for a good deal of argument: in 
order for a capital sentence to be passed, is a single full proof enough 
or must it be accompanied by other slighter clues? Are two approxi¬ 
mate proofs always equivalent to a full proof? Should not three be 
required or two plus distant clues? Are there elements that may be 
regarded as clues only for certain crimes, in certain circumstances 
and in relation to certain persons (thus evidence is disregarded if it 
comes from a vagabond; it is reinforced, on the contrary, if it is 
provided by ‘a considerable person’ or by a master in the case of a 
domestic offence). It is an arithmetic modulated by casuistry, whose 
function is to define how a legal proof is to be constructed. On the 
one hand, this system of ‘legal proofs’ makes truth in the penal 
domain the result of a complex art; it obeys rules known only to 
specialists, and, consequently, it reinforces the principle of secrecy. 
‘It is not enough that the judge should have the conviction that any 
reasonable man may have. . . Nothing is more incorrect than this 
way of judging, which, in truth, is no other than a more or less well- 

( founded opinion.’ But, on the other hand, it is a severe constraint 
for the magistrate; in the absence of this regularity, ‘every sentence 
would be reckless, and in a sense it may be said that it is unjust even 
when, in truth, the accused is guilty’ (Poullain du Parc, 112-13 - see 
also Esmein, 260-83 and Mittermaier, 15—19). The day will come 
when the singularity of this judicial truth will appear scandalous: 
as if the law did not have to obey the rules of common truth. ‘What 
would be said of a semi-proof in the sciences capable of demonstra¬ 
tion? What would a geometrical or algebraic semi-proof amount 
to?’ (Seigneux de Correvon, 63). But it should not be forgotten 
that these formal constraints on legal proof were a mode of regula¬ 
tion internal to absolute power and exclusive of knowledge.
