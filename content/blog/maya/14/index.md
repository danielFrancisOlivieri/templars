>         - Maya Angelou


The barrenness of Stamps was exactly what I wanted, 
without will or consciousness. After St. Louis, with its noise 
and activity, its trucks and buses, and loud family gatherings, I 
welcomed the obscure lanes and lonely bungalows set back 
deep in dirt yards. 

The resignation of its inhabitants encouraged me to relax. 
They showed me a contentment based on the belief that 
nothing more was coming to them, although a great deal 
more was due. Their decision to be satisfied with life’s 
inequities was a lesson for me. Entering Stamps, I had the 
feeling that I was stepping over the border lines of the map 
and would fall, without fear, right off the end of the world. 
Nothing more could happen, for in Stamps nothing 
happened. 

Into this cocoon I crept. 

For an indeterminate time, nothing was demanded of me 
or of Bailey. We were, after all, Mrs. Henderson’s California 
grandchildren, and had been away on a glamorous trip way 
up North to the fabulous St. Louis. Our father had come the 
year before, driving a big, shiny automobile and speaking the 
King’s English with a big city accent, so all we had to do was 
lie quiet for months and rake in the profits of our adventures. 

Farmers and maids, cooks and handymen, carpenters and 
all the children in town, made regular pilgrimages to the 
Store. “Just to see the travelers.” 

They stood around like cutout cardboard figures and 
asked, “Well, how is it up North?” 

“See any of them big buildings?” 

“Ever ride in one of them elevators?” 

“Was you scared?” 

“Whitefolks any different, like they say?” 

Bailey took it upon himself to answer every question, and 
from a corner of his lively imagination wove a tapestry of 
entertainment for them that I was sure was as foreign to him 
as it was to me. 

He, as usual, spoke precisely. “They have, in the North, 
buildings so high that for months, in the winter, you can’t see 
the top floors.” 

“Tell the truth.” 

“They’ve got watermelons twice the size of a cow’s head 
and sweeter than syrup.” I distinctly remember his intent face 
and the fascinated faces of his listeners. “And if you can count 
the watermelon’s seeds, before it’s cut open, you can win five 
zillion dollars and a new car.” 

Momma, knowing Bailey, warned, “Now Ju, be careful 
you don’t slip up on a not true.” (Nice people didn’t say “lie.”) 
“Everybody wears new clothes and have inside toilets. If 
you fall down in one of them, you get flushed away into the 
Mississippi River. Some people have iceboxes, only the proper 
name is Cold Spot or Frigidaire. The snow is so deep you can 
get buried right outside your door and people won’t find you 



for a year. We made ice cream out of the snow.” That was the 
only fact that I could have supported. During the winter, we 
had collected a bowl of snow and poured Pet milk over it, and 
sprinkled it with sugar and called it ice cream. 

Momma beamed and Uncle Willie was proud when 
Bailey regaled the customers with our exploits. We were 
drawing cards for the Store and objects of the town’s adora- 
tion. Our journey to magical places alone was a spot of color 
on the town’s drab canvas, and our return made us even more 
the most enviable of people. 

High spots in Stamps were usually negative: droughts, 
floods, lynchings and deaths. 

Bailey played on the country folks’ need for diversion. Just 
after our return he had taken to sarcasm, picked it up as one 
might pick up a stone, and put it snufflike under his lip. The 
double entendres, the two-pronged sentences, slid over his 
tongue to dart rapier-like into anything that happened to be in 
the way. Our customers, though, generally were so straight 
thinking and speaking that they were never hurt by his 
attacks. They didn’t comprehend them. 

“Bailey Junior sound just like Big Bailey. Got a silver 
tongue. Just like his daddy.” 

“I hear tell they don’t pick cotton up there. How the 
people live then?” 

Bailey said that the cotton up North was so tall, if ordinary 
people tried to pick it they’d have to get up on ladders, so the 
cotton farmers had their cotton picked by machines. 

For a while I was the only recipient of Bailey’s kindness. It 
was not that he pitied me but that he felt we were in the same 
boat for different reasons, and that I could understand his 
frustration just as he could countenance my withdrawal. 

I never knew if Uncle Willie had been told about the
incident in St. Louis, but sometimes I caught him watching 
me with a far-off look in his big eyes. Then he would quickly 
send me on some errand that would take me out of his pres- 
ence. When that happened I was both relieved and ashamed. I 
certainly didn’t want a cripple’s sympathy (that would have 
been a case of the blind leading the blind), nor did I want 
Uncle Willie, whom I loved in my fashion, to think of me as 
being sinful and dirty. If he thought so, at least I didn’t want 
to know it. 

Sounds came to me dully, as if people were speaking 
through their handkerchiefs or with their hands over their 
mouths. Colors weren’t true either, but rather a vague assort- 
ment of shaded pastels that indicated not so much color as 
faded familiarities. People’s names escaped me and I began to 
worry over my sanity. After all, we had been away less than a 
year, and customers whose accounts I had formerly remem- 
bered without consulting the ledger were now complete 
strangers. 

People, except Momma and Uncle Willie, accepted my 
unwillingness to talk as a natural outgrowth of a reluctant 
return to the South. And an indication that I was pining for 
the high times we had had in the big city. Then, too, I was 
well known for being “tender-hearted.” Southern Negroes 
used that term to mean sensitive and tended to look upon a 
person with that affliction as being a little sick or in delicate 
health. So I was not so much forgiven as I was understood. 

For nearly a year, I sopped around the house, the Store, the 
school and the church, like an old biscuit, dirty and inedible. 
Then I met, or rather got to know, the lady who threw me my 
first life line. 

Mrs. Bertha Flowers was the aristocrat of Black Stamps. 
She had the grace of control to appear warm in the coldest 
weather, and on the Arkansas summer days it seemed she had 
a private breeze which swirled around, cooling her. She was 
thin without the taut look of wiry people, and her printed 
voile dresses and flowered hats were as right for her as denim 
overalls for a farmer. She was our side’s answer to the richest 
white woman in town. 

Her skin was a rich black that would have peeled like a 
plum if snagged, but then no one would have thought of get- 
ting close enough to Mrs. Flowers to ruffle her dress, let along 
snag her skin. She didn’t encourage familiarity. She wore 
gloves too. 

I don t think I ever saw Mrs. Flowers laugh, but she 
smiled often. A slow widening of her thin black lips to show
even, small white teeth, then the slow effortless closing. When 
she chose to smile on me, I always wanted to thank her. The 
action was so graceful and inclusively benign. 

She was one of the few gentlewomen I have ever known, 
and has remained throughout my life the measure of what a 
human being can be. 

Momma had a strange relationship with her. Most often 
when she passed on the road in front of the Store, she spoke 
to Momma in that soft yet carrying voice, “Good day, Mrs. 
Henderson.” Momma responded with “How you, Sister 
Flowers?” 

Mrs. Flowers didn’t belong to our church, nor was she 
Momma’s familiar. Why on earth did she insist on calling her 
Sister Flowers? Shame made me want to hide my face. Mrs. 
Flowers deserved better than to be called Sister. Then, Momma 
left out the verb. Why not ask, “How are you, Mrs. Flowers?” 
With the unbalanced passion of the young, I hated her for 
showing her ignorance to Mrs. Flowers. It didn’t occur to me 
for many years that they were as alike as sisters, separated only 
by formal education. 

Although I was upset, neither of the women was in the 
least shaken by what I thought an unceremonious greeting. 
Mrs. Flowers would continue her easy gait up the hill to her 
little bungalow, and Momma kept on shelling peas or doing 
whatever had brought her to the front porch. 

Occasionally, though, Mrs. Flowers would drift off the 
road and down to the Store and Momma would say to me, 
“Sister, you go on and play.” As I left I would hear the begin- 
ning of an intimate conversation. Momma persistently using 
the wrong verb, or none at all. 

“Brother and Sister Wilcox is sho’ly the meanest — ” “Is,” 
Momma? “Is”? Oh, please, not “is,” Momma, for two or more. 



But they talked, and from the side of the building where I 
waited for the ground to open up and swallow me, I heard the 
soft-voiced Mrs. Flowers and the textured voice of my grand- 
mother merging and melting. They were interrupted from 
time to time by giggles that must have come from Mrs. Flowers 
(Momma never giggled in her life). Then she was gone. 

She appealed to me because she was like people I had 
never met personally. Like women in English novels who 
walked the moors (whatever they were) with their loyal dogs 
racing at a respectful distance. Like the women who sat in 
front of roaring fireplaces, drinking tea incessantly from silver 
trays full of scones and crumpets. Women who walked over 
the “heath” and read morocco-bound books and had two last 
names divided by a hyphen. It would be safe to say that she 
made me proud to be Negro, just by being herself. 

She acted just as refined as whitefolks in the movies and 
books and she was more beautiful, for none of them could 
have come near that warm color without looking gray by 
comparison. 

It was fortunate that I never saw her in the company of 
powhitefolks. For since they tend to think of their whiteness 
as an evenizer, I’m certain that I would have had to hear her 
spoken to commonly as Bertha, and my image of her would 
have been shattered like the unmendable Humpty-Dumpty. 

One summer afternoon, sweet-milk fresh in my memory, 
she stopped at the Store to buy provisions. Another Negro 
woman of her health and age would have been expected to 
carry the paper sacks home in one hand, but Momma said, 
“Sister Flowers, I’ll send Bailey up to your house with these 
things.” 

She smiled that slow dragging smile, “Thank you, Mrs. 
Henderson. I’d prefer Marguerite, though.” My name was 
beautiful when she said it. “I’ve been meaning to talk to her, 
anyway.” They gave each other age-group looks. 

Momma said, “Well, that’s all right then. Sister, go and 
change your dress. You going to Sister Flowers’.” 

The chifforobe was a maze. What on earth did one put on 
to go to Mrs. Flowers’ house? I knew I shouldn’t put on a 
Sunday dress. It might be sacrilegious. Certainly not a house 
dress, since I was already wearing a fresh one. I chose a school 
dress, naturally. It was formal without suggesting that going 
to Mrs. Flowers’ house was equivalent to attending church. 

I trusted myself back into the Store. 

“Now, don’t you look nice.” I had chosen the right thing, 
for once. 

“Mrs. Henderson, you make most of the children’s 
clothes, don’t you?” 

“Yes, ma’am. Sure do. Store-bought clothes ain’t hardly 
worth the thread it take to stitch them.” 

“I’ll say you do a lovely job, though, so neat. That dress 
looks professional.” 

Momma was enjoying the seldom-received compliments. 
Since everyone we knew (except Mrs. Flowers, of course) 
could sew competently, praise was rarely handed out for the 
commonly practiced craft. 

“I try, with the help of the Lord, Sister Flowers, to finish 
the inside just like I does the outside. Come here, Sister.” 

I had buttoned up the collar and tied the belt, apronlike, in 
back. Momma told me to turn around. With one hand she 
pulled the strings and the belt fell free at both sides of my 
waist. Then her large hands were at my neck, opening the 
button loops. I was terrified. What was happening? 

“Take it off, Sister.” She had her hands on the hem of the 
dress. 



I don t need to see the inside,” Mrs. Henderson, I can 
tell . . . But the dress was over my head and my arms were 
stuck in the sleeves. Momma said, “That’ll do. See here, Sister 
Flowers, I French-seams around the armholes.” Through the 
cloth film, I saw the shadow approach. “That makes it last 
longer. Children these days would bust out of sheet-metal 
clothes. They so rough.” 

That is a very good job, Mrs. Henderson. You should be 
proud. You can put your dress back on, Marguerite.” 

No ma am. Pride is a sin. And ’cording to the Good 
Book, it goeth before a fall.” 

That s right. So the Bible says. It’s a good thing to keep in 
mind.” 

I wouldn’t look at either of them. Momma hadn’t thought 
that taking off my dress in front of Mrs. Flowers would kill 
me stone dead. If I had refused, she would have thought I was 
trymg to be womanish” and might have remembered St. 
Louis. Mrs. Flowers had known that I would be embarrassed 
and that was even worse. I picked up the groceries and went 
out to wait in the hot sunshine. It would be fitting if I got a 
sunstroke and died before they came outside. Just dropped 
dead on the slanting porch. 

There was a little path beside the rocky road, and Mrs. 
Flowers walked in front swinging her arms and picking her 
way over the stones. 

She said, without turning her head, to me, “I hear you’re 
doing very good school work, Marguerite, but that it’s all 
written. The teachers report that they have trouble getting 
you to talk in class.” We passed the triangular farm on our left 
and the path widened to allow us to walk together. I hung 
back in the separate unasked and unanswerable questions. 

“Come and walk along with me, Marguerite.” I couldn’t 
have refused even if I wanted to. She pronounced my name so 
nicely. Or more correctly, she spoke each word with such 
clarity that I was certain a foreigner who didn’t understand 
English could have understood her. 

“Now no one is going to make you talk — possibly no one 
can. But bear in mind, language is man’s way of communi- 
cating with his fellow man and it is language alone which 
separates him from the lower animals.” That was a totally 
new idea to me, and I would need time to think about it. 

“Your grandmother says you read a lot. Every chance you 
get. That’s good, but not good enough. Words mean more 
than what is set down on paper. It takes the human voice to 
infuse them with the shades of deeper meaning.” 

I memorized the part about the human voice infusing 
words. It seemed so valid and poetic. 

She said she was going to give me some books and that I 
not only must read them, I must read them aloud. She sug- 
gested that I try to make a sentence sound in as many different 
ways as possible. 

“I’ll accept no excuse if you return a book to me that has 
been badly handled.” My imagination boggled at the punish- 
ment I would deserve if in fact I did abuse a book of Mrs. 
Flowers’. Death would be too kind and brief. 

The odors in the house surprised me. Somehow I had 
never connected Mrs. Flowers with food or eating or any 
other common experience of common people. There must 
have been an outhouse, too, but my mind never recorded it. 

The sweet scent of vanilla had met us as she opened 
the door. 

“I made tea cookies this morning. You see, I had planned 
to invite you for cookies and lemonade so we could have this 
little chat. The lemonade is in the icebox.” 



It followed that Mrs. Flowers would have ice on an ordi- 
nary day, when most families in our town bought ice late on 
Saturdays only a few times during the summer to be used in 
the wooden ice-cream freezers. 

She took the bags from me and disappeared through the 
kitchen door. I looked around the room that I had never in 
my wildest fantasies imagined I would see. Browned photo- 
graphs leered or threatened from the walls and the white, 
freshly done curtains pushed against themselves and against 
the wind. I wanted to gobble up the room entire and take it to 
Bailey, who would help me analyze and enjoy it. 

“Have a seat, Marguerite. Over there by the table.” She 
carried a platter covered with a tea towel. Although she 
warned that she hadn’t tried her hand at baking sweets for 
some time, I was certain that like everything else about her the 
cookies would be perfect. 

They were flat round wafers, slightly browned on the 
edges and butter-yellow in the center. With the cold lemonade 
they were sufficient for childhood’s lifelong diet. Remem- 
bering my manners, I took nice little lady-like bites off the 
edges. She said she had made them expressly for me and that 
she had a few in the kitchen that I could take home to my 
Brother. So I jammed one whole cake in my mouth and the 
rough crumbs scratched the insides of my jaws, and if I hadn’t 
had to swallow, it would have been a dream come true. 

As I ate she began the first of what we later called “my 
lessons in living.” She said that I must always be intolerant of 
ignorance but understanding of illiteracy. That some people, 
unable to go to school, were more educated and even more 
intelligent than college professors. She encouraged me to 
listen carefully to what country people called mother wit. 

That in those homely sayings was couched the collective 
wisdom of generations. 

When I finished the cookies she brushed off the table and 
brought a thick, small book from the bookcase. I had read A 
Tale of Two Cities and found it up to my standards as a 
romantic novel. She opened the first page and I heard poetry 
for the first time in my life. 

“It was the best of time and the worst of times . . .” Her 
voice slid in and curved down through and over the words. 
She was nearly singing. I wanted to look at the pages. Were 
they the same that I had read? Or were there notes, music, 
lined on the pages, as in a hymn book? Her sounds began cas- 
cading gently. I knew from listening to a thousand preachers 
that she was nearing the end of her reading, and I hadn’t 
really heard, heard to understand, a single word. 

“How do you like that?” 

It occurred to me that she expected a response. The sweet 
vanilla flavor was still on my tongue and her reading was a 
wonder in my ears. I had to speak. 

I said, “Yes, ma’am.” It was the least I could do, but it was 
the most also. 

“There’s one more thing. Take this book of poems and 
memorize one for me. Next time you pay me a visit, I want 
you to recite.” 

I have tried often to search behind the sophistication of 
years for the enchantment I so easily found in those gifts. The 
essence escapes but its aura remains. To be allowed, no, 
invited, into the private lives of strangers, and to share their 
joys and lears, was a chance to exchange the Southern bitter 
wormwood for a cup of mead with Beowulf or a hot cup of tea 
and milk with Oliver Twist. When I said aloud, “It is a far, far 



better thing that I do, than I have ever done . . .” tears of love 
filled my eyes at my selflessness. 

On that first day, I ran down the hill and into the road 
(few cars ever came along it) and had the good sense to stop 
running before I reached the Store. 

I was liked, and what a difference it made. I was respected 
not as Mrs. Henderson’s grandchild or Bailey’s sister but for 
just being Marguerite Johnson. 

Childhood’s logic never asks to be proved (all conclusions 
are absolute). I didn’t question why Mrs. Flowers had singled 
me out for attention, nor did it occur to me that Momma 
might have asked her to give me a little talking to. All I cared 
about was that she had made tea cookies for me and read to 
me from her favorite book. It was enough to prove that she 
liked me. 

Momma and Bailey were waiting inside the Store. He 
said, “My, what did she give you?” He had seen the books, but 
I held the paper sack with his cookies in my arms shielded by 
the poems. 

Momma said, “Sister, I know you acted like a little lady. 
That do my heart good to see settled people take to you all. 
I’m trying my best, the Lord knows, but these days . . .” Her 
voice trailed off. “Go on in and change your dress.” 

In the bedroom it was going to be a joy to see Bailey 
receive his cookies. I said, “By the way, Bailey, Mrs. Flowers 
sent you some tea cookies — ” 

Momma shouted, “What did you say, Sister? You, Sister, 
what did you say?” Hot anger was crackling in her voice. 

Bailey said, “She said Mrs. Flowers sent me some—” 

I ain t talking to you, Ju.” I heard the heavy feet walk 
across the floor toward our bedroom. “Sister, you heard me. 
What s that you said? She swelled to fill the doorway. 

Bailey said, “Momma.” His pacifying voice— “Momma, 
she—” 

“You shut up, Ju. I’m talking to your sister.” 

I didn’t know what sacred cow I had bumped, but it was 

better to find out than to hang like a thread over an open fire. 

I repeated, “I said, ‘Bailey, by the way, Mrs. Flowers sent 
> >> 

you— 

“That’s what I thought you said. Go on and take off your 
dress. I’m going to get a switch.” 

At first I thought she was playing. Maybe some heavy joke 
that would end with “You sure she didn’t send me some- 
thing?” but in a minute she was back in the room with a long, 
ropy, peach-tree switch, the juice smelling bitter at having 
been torn loose. She said, “Get down on your knees. Bailey, 
Junior, you come on, too.” 

The three of us knelt as she began, “Our Father, you 
know the tribulations of your humble servant. I have with 
your help raised two grown boys. Many’s the day I thought I 
wouldn’t be able to go on, but you gave me the strength to see 
my way clear. Now, Lord, look down on this heavy heart 
today. I’m trying to raise my son’s children in the way they 
should go, but, oh. Lord, the Devil try to hinder me on every 
hand. I never thought I’d live to hear cursing under this roof, 
what I try to keep dedicated to the glorification of God. And 
cursing out of the mouths of babes. But you said, in the last 
days brother would turn against brother, and children against 
their parents. That there would be a gnashing of teeth and a 
rendering of flesh. Father, forgive this child, I beg you, on 
bended knee.” 

I was crying loudly now. Momma’s voice had risen to a 
shouting pitch, and I knew that whatever wrong I had com- 
mitted was extremely serious. She had even left the Store 

untended to take up my case with God. When she finished we 
were all crying. She pulled me to her with one hand and hit 
me only a few times with the switch. The shock of my sin and 
the emotional release of her prayer had exhausted her. 

Momma wouldn’t talk right then, but later in the evening 
I found that my violation lay in using the phrase “by the way.” 
Momma explained that “Jesus was the Way, the Truth and 
the Light,” and anyone who says “by the way” is really saying, 
by Jesus, or “by God,” and the Lord’s name would not be 
taken in vain in her house. 

When Bailey tried to interpret the words with: “White- 
folks use ‘by the way’ to mean while we’re on the subject,” 
Momma reminded us that “whitefolks’ mouths were most in 
general loose and their words were an abomination before 
Christ.” 

Recently a white woman from Texas, who would quickly 
describe herself as a liberal, asked me about my hometown. 
When I told her that in Stamps my grandmother had owned 
the only Negro general merchandise store since the turn of the 
century, she exclaimed, “Why, you were a debutante.” Ridicu- 
lous and even ludicrous. But Negro girls in small Southern 
towns, whether poverty-stricken or just munching along on a 
few of life s necessities, were given as extensive and irrelevant 
preparations for adulthood as rich white girls shown in maga- 
zines. Admittedly the training was not the same. While white 
girls learned to waltz and sit gracefully with a tea cup bal- 
anced on their knees, we were lagging behind, learning the 
mid-Victorian values with very little money to indulge them. 
(Come and see Edna Lomax spending the money she made 
picking cotton on five balls of ecru tatting thread. Her fingers 
are bound to snag the work and she’ll have to repeat the 
stitches time and time again. But she knows that when she 
buys the thread.) 

We were required to embroider and I had trunkfuls of 



colored dishtowels, pillowcases, runners and handkerchiefs to 
my credit. I mastered the art of crocheting and tatting, and 
there was a lifetime’s supply of dainty doilies that would never 
be used in sacheted dresser drawers. It went without saying 
that all girls could iron and wash, but the finer touches around 
the home, like setting a table with real silver, baking roasts 
and cooking vegetables without meat, had to be learned else- 
where. Usually at the source of those habits. During my tenth 
year, a white woman’s kitchen became my finishing school. 

Mrs. Viola Cullinan was a plump woman who lived in a 
three-bedroom house somewhere behind the post office. She 
was singularly unattractive until she smiled, and then the lines 
around her eyes and mouth which made her look perpetually 
dirty disappeared, and her face looked like the mask of an 
impish elf. She usually rested her smile until late afternoon 
when her women friends dropped in and Miss Glory, the 
cook, served them cold drinks on the closed-in porch. 

The exactness of her house was inhuman. This glass went 
here and only here. That cup had its place and it was an act of 
impudent rebellion to place it anywhere else. At twelve 
o clock the table was set. At 12:15 Mrs. Cullinan sat down to 
dinner (whether her husband had arrived or not). At 12:16 
Miss Glory brought out the food. 

It took me a week to learn the difference between a salad 
plate, a bread plate and a dessert plate. 

Mrs. Cullinan kept up the tradition of her wealthy par- 
ents. She was from Virginia. Miss Glory, who was a descen- 
dant of slaves that had worked for the Cullinans, told me her 
history. She had married beneath her (according to Miss 
Glory). Her husband’s family hadn’t had their money very 
long and what they had “didn’t ’mount to much.” 

As ugly as she was, I thought privately, she was lucky to 

get a husband above or beneath her station. But Miss Glory 
wouldn t let me say a thing against her mistress. She was very 
patient with me, however, over the housework. She explained 
the dishware, silverware and servants’ bells. 

The large round bowl in which soup was served wasn’t a 
soup bowl, it was a tureen. There were goblets, sherbet 
glasses, ice-cream glasses, wine glasses, green glass coffee cups 
with matching saucers, and water glasses. I had a glass to 
drink from, and it sat with Miss Glory’s on a separate shelf 
from the others. Soup spoons, gravy boat, butter knives, salad 
forks and carving platter were additions to my vocabulary and 
in fact almost represented a new language. I was fascinated 
with the novelty, with the fluttering Mrs. Cullinan and her 
Alice-in- Wonderland house. 

Her husband remains, in my memory, undefined. I 
lumped him with all the other white men that I had ever seen 
and tried not to see. 

On our way home one evening, Miss Glory told me that 
Mrs. Cullman couldn t have children. She said that she was 
too delicate-boned. It was hard to imagine bones at all under 
those layers of fat. Miss Glory went on to say that the doctor 
had taken out all her lady organs. I reasoned that a pig’s 
organs included the lungs, heart and liver, so if Mrs. Cullinan 
was walking around without those essentials, it explained why 
she drank alcohol out of unmarked bottles. She was keeping 
herself embalmed. 

When I spoke to Bailey about it, he agreed that I was 
right, but he also informed me that Mr. Cullinan had two 
daughters by a colored lady and that I knew them very well. 
He added that the girls were the spitting image of their father. 

I was unable to remember what he looked like, although I had 
just left him a few hours before, but I thought of the Coleman 



girls. They were very light-skinned and certainly didn’t look 
very much like their mother (no one ever mentioned Mr. 
Coleman). 

My pity for Mrs. Cullinan preceded me the next morning 
like the Cheshire cat’s smile. Those girls, who could have been 
her daughters, were beautiful. They didn’t have to straighten 
their hair. Even when they were caught in the rain, their braids 
still hung down straight like tamed snakes. Their mouths were 
pouty little cupid’s bows. Mrs. Cullinan didn’t know what she 
missed. Or maybe she did. Poor Mrs. Cullinan. 

For weeks after, I arrived early, left late and tried very 
hard to make up for her barrenness. If she had had her own 
children, she wouldn’t have had to ask me to run a thousand 
errands from her back door to the back door of her friends. 
Poor old Mrs. Cullinan. 

Then one evening Miss Glory told me to serve the ladies 
on the porch. After I set the tray down and turned toward the 
kitchen, one of the women asked, “What’s your name, girl?” 
It was the speckled-faced one. Mrs. Cullinan said, “She 
doesn t talk much. Her name’s Margaret.” 

“Is she dumb?” 

“No. As I understand it, she can talk when she wants 
to but she s usually quiet as a little mouse. Aren’t you, 
Margaret?” 

I smiled at her. Poor thing. No organs and couldn’t even 
pronounce my name correctly. 

“She’s a sweet little thing, though.” 

Well, that may be, but the name’s too long. I’d never 
bother myself. I’d call her Mary if I was you.” 

I fumed into the kitchen. That horrible woman would 
never have the chance to call me Mary because if I was 
starving I’d never work for her. I decided I wouldn’t pee on 

her if her heart was on fire. Giggles drifted in off the porch 
and into Miss Glory’s pots. I wondered what they could be 
laughing about. 

Whitefolks were so strange. Could they be talking about 
me? Everybody knew that they stuck together better than the 
Negroes did. It was possible that Mrs. Cullinan had friends in 
St. Louis who heard about a girl from Stamps being in court 
and wrote to tell her. Maybe she knew about Mr. Freeman. 

My lunch was in my mouth a second time and I went out- 
side and relieved myself on the bed of four-o’clocks. Miss 
Glory thought I might be coming down with something and 
told me to go on home, that Momma would give me some 
herb tea, and she’d explain to her mistress. 

I realized how foolish I was being before I reached the 
pond. Of course Mrs. Cullinan didn’t know. Otherwise she 
wouldn’t have given me the two nice dresses that Momma cut 
down, and she certainly wouldn’t have called me a “sweet 
little thing.” My stomach felt fine, and I didn’t mention any- 
thing to Momma. 

That evening I decided to write a poem on being white, 
fat, old and without children. It was going to be a tragic 
ballad. I would have to watch her carefully to capture the 
essence of her loneliness and pain. 

The very next day, she called me by the wrong name. Miss 
Glory and I were washing up the lunch dishes when Mrs. Cul- 
linan came to the doorway. “Mary?” 

Miss Glory asked, “Who?” 

Mrs. Cullinan, sagging a little, knew and I knew. “I want 
Mary to go down to Mrs. Randall’s and take her some soup. 
She’s not been feeling well for a few days.” 

Miss Glory’s face was a wonder to see. “You mean Mar- 
garet, ma’am. Her name’s Margaret.” 



“That’s too long. She’s Mary from now on. Heat that soup 
from last night and put it in the china tureen and, Mary, I 
want you to carry it carefully.” 

Every person I knew had a hellish horror of being “called 
out of his name.” It was a dangerous practice to call a Negro 
anything that could be loosely construed as insulting because 
of the centuries of their having been called niggers, jigs, 
dinges, blackbirds, crows, boots and spooks. 

Miss Glory had a fleeting second of feeling sorry for me. 
Then as she handed me the hot tureen she said, “Don’t mind, 
don t pay that no mind. Sticks and stones may break your 
bones, but words . . . You know, I been working for her for 
twenty years.” 

She held the back door open for me. “Twenty years. I 
wasn’t much older than you. My name used to be Hallelujah. 
That s what Ma named me, but my mistress give me ‘Glory,’ 
and it stuck. I likes it better too.” 

I was in the little path that ran behind the houses when 
Miss Glory shouted, “It’s shorter too.” 

For a few seconds it was a tossup over whether I would 
laugh (imagine being named Hallelujah) or cry (imagine let- 
ting some white woman rename you for her convenience). My 
anger saved me from either outburst. I had to quit the job, but 
the problem was going to be how to do it. Momma wouldn’t 
allow me to quit for just any reason. 

“She’s a peach. That woman is a real peach.” Mrs. Ran- 
dall s maid was talking as she took the soup from me, and I 
wondered what her name used to be and what she answered 
to now. 

For a week I looked into Mrs. Cullinan’s face as she called 
me Mary. She ignored my coming late and leaving early. Miss 
Glory was a little annoyed because I had begun to leave egg 

yolk on the dishes and wasn’t putting much heart in polishing 
the silver. I hoped that she would complain to our boss, but 
she didn’t. 

Then Bailey solved my dilemma. He had me describe the 
contents of the cupboard and the particular plates she liked 
best. Her favorite piece was a casserole shaped like a fish and 
the green glass coffee cups. I kept his instructions in mind, so 
on the next day when Miss Glory was hanging out clothes and 
I had again been told to serve the old biddies on the porch, I 
dropped the empty serving tray. When I heard Mrs. Cullinan 
scream, Mary! ’ I picked up the casserole and two of the 
green glass cups in readiness. As she rounded the kitchen door 
I let them fall on the tiled floor. 

I could never absolutely describe to Bailey what happened 
next, because each time I got to the part where she fell on the 
floor and screwed up her ugly face to cry, we burst out 
laughing. She actually wobbled around on the floor and 
picked up shards of the cups and cried, “Oh, Momma. Oh, 
dear Gawd. It’s Momma’s china from Virginia. Oh, Momma, 
I sorry.” 

Miss Glory came running in from the yard and the 
women from the porch crowded around. Miss Glory was 
almost as broken up as her mistress. “You mean to say she 
broke our Virginia dishes? What we gone do?” 

Mrs. Cullinan cried louder, “That clumsy nigger. Clumsy 
little black nigger.” 

Old speckled-face leaned down and asked, “Who did it, 
Viola? Was it Mary? Who did it?” 

Everything was happening so fast I can’t remember 
whether her action preceded her words, but I know that Mrs. 
Cullinan said, “Her name’s Margaret, goddamn it, her name’s 
Margaret! And she threw a wedge of the broken plate at me. 



It could have been the hysteria which put her aim off, but the 

flying crockery caught Miss Glory right over her ear and she 
started screaming. 

I left the front door wide open so all the neighbors 
could hear. 

Mrs. Cullinan was right about one thing. My name 
wasn’t Mary.
