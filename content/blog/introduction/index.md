&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think in paragraphs. Paragraphs seem to be thought gussied up in its Sunday best and standing still at attention. They have clear beginnings, clear lines of argument, a logical movement. Thought in action rarely behaves so well. Each thought truncates the one before it. My inner monologue is forever interrupting itself. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I initially saw footnotes as a possible way to mimic the idiosyncratic flow of thought. By inserting footnotes across an otherwise unblemished piece of prose, I might be able to have the text distract you from itself in the same way that my mind does. The issue is that footnotes only get you halfway there. They hint at the unwieldy nature of the mind, but don't capture the full extent of it. For footnotes to go all the way, each footnote would itself have to have several footnotes which would then have several of their own. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I discovered the form I was looking for in a computer science class: the binary tree. It started with one node and then split off into two and then each of those two split further down. Here it was: this is what thought felt like to me. Each thought always dividing itself.
