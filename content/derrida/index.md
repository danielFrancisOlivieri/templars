&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps something has occurred in the history of the concept of structure that could be called an
“event,” if this loaded word did not entail a meaning which it is precisely the function of
structural—or structurality—thought to reduce or to suspect. But let me use the term “event”
anyway, employing it with caution and as if in quotation marks. In this sense, this event will
have the exterior form of a rupture and a redoubling.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be easy enough to show that the concept of structure and even the word
“structure” itself are as old as the epistémé—that is to say, as old as western science and western philosophy—and that their roots thrust deep into the soil of ordinary language, into whose deepest recesses the epistémé plunges to gather them together once more, making them part of itself in a metaphorical displacement. Nevertheless, up until the event which I wish to mark out and define, structure-or rather the structurality of structure—although it has always been involved, has always been neutralized or reduced, and this by a process of giving it a center or referring it to a point of presence, a fixed origin. The function of this center was not only to orient; balance, and organize the structure—one cannot in fact conceive of an unorganized structure—but above all to make sure that the organizing principle of the structure would limit
what we might call the freeplay of the structure. No doubt that by orienting and organizing the coherence of the system, the center of a structure permits the freeplay of its elements inside the total form. And even today the notion of a structure lacking any center represents the unthinkable itself.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the center also closes off the freeplay it opens up and makes possible. Qua
center, it is the point at which the substitution of contents, elements, or terms is no longer
possible. At the center, the permutation or the transformation of elements (which may of course
be structures enclosed within a structure) is forbidden. At least this permutation has always
remained interdicted (I use this word deliberately). Thus it has always been thought that the
center, which is by definition unique, constituted that very thing within a structure which governs
the structure, while escaping structurality. This is why classical thought concerning structure
could say that the center is, paradoxically, within the structure and outside it. The center is at the
center of the totality, and yet, since the center does not belong to the totality (is not part of the
totality), the totality has its center elsewhere. The center is not the center. The concept of
centered structure—although it represents coherence itself, the condition of the epistémé as
philosophy or science—is contradictorily coherent. And, as always, coherence in contradiction
expresses the force of a desire. The concept of centered structure is in fact the concept of a
freeplay based on a fundamental ground, a freeplay which is constituted upon a fundamental
immobility and a reassuring certitude, which is itself beyond the reach of the freeplay. With this
certitude anxiety can be mastered, for anxiety is invariably the result of a certain mode of being
implicated in the game, of being caught by the game, of being as it were from the very beginning
at stake in the game.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the basis of what we therefore call the center (and which, because it
can be either inside or outside, is as readily called the origin as the end, as readily arché as telos),
the repetitions, the substitutions, the transformations, and the permutations are always taken from
a history of meaning [sens]—that is, a history, period—whose origin may always be revealed or
whose end may always be anticipated in the form of presence. This is why one could perhaps say
that the movement of any archeology, like that of any eschatology, is an accomplice of this reduction of the structurality of structure and always attempts to conceive of structure from the basis of a full presence which is out of play.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is so, the whole history of the concept of structure, before the rupture I spoke of,
must be thought of as a series of substitutions of center for center, as a linked chain of
determinations of the center. Successively, and in a regulated fashion, the center receives
different forms or names. The history of metaphysics, like the history of the West, is the history
of these metaphors and metonymies. Its matrix—if you will pardon me for demonstrating so
little and for being so elliptical in order to bring me more quickly to my principal theme—is the
determination of being as presence in all the senses of this word. It would be possible to show
that all the names related to fundamentals, to principles, or to the center have always designated
the constant of a presence—eidos, arché, telos, energeia, ousia (essence, existence, substance,
subject) aletheia, transcendentality, consciousness, or conscience, God, man, and so forth.
The event I called a rupture, the disruption I alluded to at the beginning of this paper,
would presumably have come about when the structurality of structure had to begin to be
thought, that is to say, repeated, and this is why I said that this disruption was repetition in all of
the senses of this word. From then on it became necessary to think the law which governed, as it
were, the desire for the center in the constitution of structure and the process of signification
prescribing its displacements and its substitutions for this law of the central presence—but a
central presence which was never itself, which has always already been transported outside itself
in its surrogate. The surrogate does not substitute itself for anything which has somehow preexisted it. From then on it was probably necessary to begin to think that there was no center, that the center would not be thought in the form of a being-present, that the center had no natural
locus, that it was not a fixed locus but a function, a sort of non-locus in which an infinite number
of sign-substitutions came into play. This moment was that in which language invaded the
universal problematic; that in which, in the absence of a center or origin, everything became
discourse-provided we can agree on this word—that is to say, when everything became a system
where the central signified, the original or transcendental signified, is never absolutely present
outside a system of differences. The absence of the transcendental signified extends the domain
and the interplay of signification ad infinitum.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where and how does this decentering, this notion of the structurality of structure, occur?
It would be somewhat naive to refer to an event, a doctrine, or an author in order to designate
this occurrence. It is no doubt part of the totality of an era, our own, but still it has already begun
to proclaim itself and begun to work. Nevertheless, if I wished to give some sort of indication by
choosing one or two “names,” and by recalling those authors in whose discourses this occurrence
has most nearly maintained its most radical formulation, I would probably cite the Nietzschean
critique of metaphysics, the critique of the concepts of being and truth, for which were
substituted the concepts of play, interpretation, and sign (sign without truth present); the
Freudian critique or self-presence, that is, the critique of consciousness, subject, of self-identity
and of self-proximity or self-possession; and, more radically, the Heideggerean destruction of
metaphysics, of onto-theology, of the determination of being as presence. But all these
destructive discourses and all their analogues are trapped in a sort of circle. This circle is unique.
It describes the form of the relationship between the history of metaphysics and the destruction
of the history of metaphysics. There is no sense in doing without the concepts of metaphysics in
order to attack metaphysics. We have no language—no syntax and no lexicon—which is alien to
this history; we cannot utter a single destructive proposition which has not already slipped into
the form, the logic, and the implicit postulations of precisely what it seeks to contest. To pick out  one example from many: the metaphysics of presence is attacked with the help of the concept of the sign. But from the moment anyone wishes this to show, as I suggested a moment ago, that
there is no transcendental or privileged signified and that the domain or the interplay of
signification has, henceforth, no limit, he ought to extend his refusal to the concept and to the
word sign itself-which is precisely what cannot be done. For the signification “sign” has always
been comprehended and determined, in its sense, as sign-of, signifier referring to a signified,
signifier different from its signified. If one erases the radical difference between signifier and
signified, it is the word signifier itself which ought to be abandoned as a metaphysical concept.
When Lévi-Strauss says in the preface to “The Raw and the Cooked” that he has “sought to transcend the opposition between the sensible and the intelligible by placing [himself] from the very beginning at the level of signs,” the necessity, the force, and the legitimacy of his act cannot
make us forget that the concept of the sign cannot in itself surpass or bypass this opposition
between the sensible and the intelligible. The concept of the sign is determined by this
opposition: through and throughout the totality of its history and by its system. But we cannot do
without the concept of the sign, we cannot give up this metaphysical complicity without also
giving up the critique we are directing against this complicity, without the risk of erasing
difference [altogether] in the self-identity of a signified reducing into itself its signifier, or, what
amounts to the same thing, simply expelling it outside itself. For there are two heterogenous
ways of erasing the difference between the signifier and the signified: one, the classic way,
consists in reducing or deriving the signifier, that is to say, ultimately in submitting the sign to
thought; the other, the one we are using here against the first one, consists in putting into
question the system in which the preceding reduction functioned: first and foremost, the
opposition between the sensible and the intelligible. The paradox is that the metaphysical
reduction of the sign needed the opposition it was reducing. The opposition is part of the system,
along with the reduction. And what I am saying here about the sign can be extended to all the
concepts and all the sentences of metaphysics, in particular to the discourse on “structure.” But
there are many ways of being caught in this circle. They are all more or less naive, more or less
empirical, more or less systematic, more or less close to the formulation or even to the
formalization of this circle. It is these differences which explain the multiplicity of destructive
discourses and the disagreement between those who make them. It was within concepts inherited
from metaphysics that Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger worked, for example. Since these
concepts are not elements or atoms and since they are taken from a syntax and a system, every
particular borrowing drags along with it the whole of metaphysics. This is what allows these
destroyers to destroy each other reciprocally-for example, Heidegger considering Nietzs che, with
as much lucidity and rigor as bad faith and misconstruction, as the last metaphysician, the last
“Platonist.” One could do the same for Heidegger himself, for Freud, or for a number of others.
And today no exercise is more widespread.
What is the relevance of this formal schema when we turn to what are called the “human
sciences”? One of them perhaps occupies a privileged place—ethnology. One can in fact assume
that ethnology could have been born as a science only at the moment when a de-centering had
come about: at the moment when European culture—and, in consequence, the history of
metaphysics and of its concepts—had been dislocated, driven from its locus, and forced to stop
considering itself as the culture of reference. This moment is not first and foremost a moment of
philosophical or scientific discourse, it is also a moment which is political, economic, technical,
and so forth. One can say in total assurance that there is nothing fortuitous about the fact that the
critique of ethnocentrism—the very condition of ethnology—should be systematically and 

historically contemporaneous with the destruction of the history of metaphysics. Both belong to a
single and same era.
Ethnology—like any science—comes about within the element of discourse. And it is
primarily a European science employing traditional concepts, however much of it may struggle
against them. Consequently, whether he wants to or not-and this does not depend on a decision
on his part-the ethnologist accepts into his discourse the premises of ethnocentrism at the very
moment when he is employed in denouncing them. This necessity is irreducible; it is not a
historical contingency. We ought to consider very carefully all its implications. But if nobody
can escape this necessity, and if no one is therefore responsible for giving in to it, however little,
this does not mean that all the ways of giving in to it are of an equal pertinence. The quality and
the fecundity of a discourse are perhaps measured by the critical rigor with which this
relationship to the history of metaphysics and to inherited concepts is thought. Here it is a
question of a critical relationship to the language of the human sciences and a question of a
critical responsibility of the discourse. It is a question of putting expressly and systematically the
problem of the status of a discourse which borrows from a heritage the resources necessary for
the deconstruction of that heritage itself. A problem of economy and strategy.
If I now go on to employ an examination of the texts of [the anthropologist Claude] LéviStrauss as an example, it is not only because of the privilege accorded to ethnology among the
human sciences, nor yet because the thought of Lévi-Strauss weighs heavily on the contemporary
theoretical situation. It is above all because a certain choice has made itself evident in the work
of Lévi-Strauss and because a certain doctrine has been elaborated there, and precisely in a more
or less explicit manner, in relation to this critique of language and to this critical language in the
human sciences.
In order to follow this movement in the text of Lévi-Strauss, let me choose as one guiding thread
among others the opposition between nature and culture. In spite of all its rejuvenations and its
disguises, this opposition is congenital to philosophy. It is even older than Plato. It is at least as
old as the Sophists. Since the statement of the opposition—physis/nomos, physis/techné—it has
been passed on to us by a whole historical chain which opposes “nature” to the law, to education,
to art, to technics—and also to liberty, to the arbitrary, to history, to society, to the mind, and so
on. From the beginnings of his quest and from his first book, The Elementary Structures of
Kinship,

 Lévi-Strauss has felt at one and the same time the necessity of utilizing this opposition
and the impossibility of making it acceptable. In the Elementary Structures, he begins from this
axiom or definition: that belongs to nature which is universal and spontaneous, not depending on
any particular culture or on any determinate norm. That belongs to culture, on the other hand,
which depends on a system of norms regulating society and is therefore capable of varying from
one social structure to another. These two definitions are of the traditional type. But, in the very
first pages of the Elementary Structures, Lévi-Strauss, who has begun to give these concepts an
acceptable standing, encounters what he calls a scandal, that is to say, something which no
longer tolerates the nature/culture opposition he has accepted and which seems to require at one
and the same time the predicates of nature and those of culture. This scandal is the incestprohibition. The incest prohibition is universal; in this sense one could call it natural. But it is
also a prohibition, a system of norms and interdicts; in this sense one could call it cultural.
Let us assume therefore that everything universal in man derives from the order of
nature and is characterized by spontaneity, that everything which is subject to a
norm belongs to culture and presents the attributes of the relative and the 

particular. We then find ourselves confronted by a fact, or rather an ensemble of
facts, which, in the light of the preceding definitions, is not far from appearing as
a scandal: the prohibition of incest presents without the least equivocation, and
indissolubly linked together, the two characteristics in which we recognized the
contradictory attributes of two exclusive orders. The prohibition of incest
constitutes a rule, but a rule, alone of all the social rules, which possesses at the
same time a universal character (9).
Obviously there is no scandal except in the interior of a system of concepts sanctioning the
difference between nature and culture. In beginning his work with the factum of the incestprohibition, Lévi-Strauss thus puts himself in a position entailing that this difference, which has
always been assumed to be self-evident, becomes obliterated or disputed. For, from the moment
that the incest prohibition can no longer be conceived within the nature/culture opposition, it can
no longer be said that it is a scandalous fact, a nucleus of opacity within a network of transparent
significations. The incest-prohibition is no longer scandal one meets with or comes up against in
the domain of traditional concepts; it is something which escapes these concepts and certainly
precedes them—probably as the condition of their possibility. It could perhaps be said that the
whole of philosophical conceptualization, systematically relating itself to the nature/culture
opposition, is designed to leave in the domain of the unthinkable the very thing that makes this
conceptualization possible: the origin of the prohibition of incest.
I have dealt too cursorily with this example, only one among so many others, but the
example nevertheless reveals that language bears within itself the necessity of its own critique.
This critique may be undertaken along two “tracks, in two “manners.” Once the limit of
nature/culture opposition makes itself felt, one might want to question systematically and
rigorously the history of these concepts. This is a first action. Such a systematic and historic
questioning would be neither a philological nor a philosophical action in the classic sense of
these words. Concerning oneself with the founding concepts of the whole history of philosophy,
de-constituting them, is not to undertake the task of the philologist or of the classic historian of
philosophy. In spite of appearances, it is probably the most daring way of making the beginnings
of a step outside of philosophy. The step “outside philosophy” is much more difficult to conceive
than is generally imagined by those who think they made it long ago with cavalier ease, and who
are in general swallowed up in metaphysics by the whole body of the discourse that they claim to
have disengaged from it.
In order to avoid the possibly sterilizing effect of the first way, the other choice—which I
feel corresponds more nearly to the way chosen by Lévi-Strauss—consists in conserving in the
field of empirical discovery all these old concepts, while at the same time exposing here and
there their limits, treating them as tools which can still be of use. No longer is any truth-value
attributed to them; there is a readiness to abandon them if necessary if other instruments should
appear more useful. In the meantime, their relative efficacy is exploited, and they are employed
to destroy the old machinery to which they belong and of which they themselves are pieces. Thus
it is that the language of the human sciences criticizes itself. Lévi-Strauss thinks that in this way
he can separate method from truth, the instruments of the method and the objective significations
aimed at by it. One could almost say that this is the primary affirmation of Lévi-Strauss; in any
event, the first words of the Elementary Structures are: “One begins to understand that the
distinction between state of nature and state of society (we would be more apt to say today: state
of nature and state of culture), while lacking any acceptable historical signification, presents a 

value which fully justifies its use by modern sociology: its value as a methodological
instrument.”
Lévi-Strauss will always remain faithful to this double intention: to preserve as an
instrument that whose truth-value he criticizes.
On the one hand, he will continue in effect to contest the value of the nature/culture
opposition. More than thirteen years after the Elementary Structures, The Savage Minds
6
faithfully echoes the text I have just quoted: “The opposition between nature and culture which I
have previously insisted on seems today to offer value which is above all methodological.” And
this methodological value is not affected by its “ontological” non-value (as could be said, if this
notion were not suspect here): “It would not be enough to have absorbed particular humanities
into a genera humanity; this first enterprise prepares the way for others ... which belong to the
natural and exact sciences: to reintegrate culture into nature, and finally, to reintegrate life into
the totality of its physiochemical conditions” (327).
On the other hand, still in The Savage Mind, he presents as what he calls bricolage7
which might be called the discourse of this method. The bricoleur, says Lévi-Strauss, is someone
who uses “the means at hand,” that is, the instruments he finds at his disposition around him,
those which are already there, which had not been especially conceived with an eye to the
operation for which they are to be used and to which one tries by trial and error to adapt them,
not hesitating to change them whenever it appears necessary, or to try several of them at once,
even if their form and their origin are heterogenous—and so forth. There is therefore a critique of
language in the form of bricolage, and it has even been possible to say that bricolage is the
critical language itself. I am thinking in particular of the article by G. Genette, “Structuralisme et
Critique litteraire,” published in homage to Lévi-Strauss in a special issue of L’Arc (no. 26,
1965), where it is stated that the analysis of bricolage could “be applied almost word for word”
to criticism, and especially to “literary criticism.”8
If one calls bricolage the necessity of borrowing one's concepts from the text of a
heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined, it must be said that every discourse is
bricoleur. The engineer, whom Lévi-Strauss opposes to the bricoleur, should be the one to
construct the totality of his language, syntax, and lexicon. In this sense the engineer is a myth. A
subject who would supposedly be the absolute origin of his own discourse and would supposedly
construct it “out of nothing,” “out of whole cloth,” would be the creator of the verbe, the verbe
itself. The notion of the engineer who had supposedly broken with all forms of bricolage is
therefore a theological idea; and since Lévi-Strauss tells us elsewhere that bricolage is
mythopoetic, the odds are that the engineer is a myth produced by the bricoleur. From the
moment that we cease to believe in such an engineer and in a discourse breaking with the
received historical discourse, as soon as it is admitted that every finite discourse is bound by a
certain bricolage, and that the engineer and the scientist are also species of bricoleurs then the
very idea of bricolage is menaced and the difference in which it took on its meaning
decomposes.
This brings out the second thread which might guide us in what is being unraveled here.
Lévi-Strauss describes bricolage not only as an intellectual activity but also as a
mythopoetical activity. One reads in The Savage Mind, “Like bricolage on the technical level,
mythical reflection can attain brilliant and unforeseen results on the intellectual level.
Reciprocally, the mythopoetical character of bricolage has often been noted” (26).
But the remarkable endeavor of Lévi-Strauss is not simply to put forward, notably in the
most recent of his investigations, a structural science or knowledge of myths and of mythological 

activity. His endeavor also appears—I would say almost from the first in the status which he
accords to his own discourse, on myths, to what he calls his “mythologicals” It is here that his
discourse on the myth reflects on itself and criticizes itself. And this moment, this critical period,
is evidently of concern to all the languages which share the field of the human sciences. What
does Lévi-Strauss say of his “mythologicals”? It is here that we rediscover the mythopoetical
virtue (power) of bricolage. In effect, what appears most fascinating in this critical search for a
new status of the discourse is the stated abandonment of all reference to a center, to a subject, to
a privileged reference, to an origin, or to an absolute arché. The theme of this decentering could
be followed throughout the “Overture” to his last book, The Raw and the Cooked. I shall simply
remark on a few key points.
1) From the very start, Lévi-Strauss recognizes that the Bororo myth which he employs in
the book as the “reference-myth” does not merit this name and this treatment. The name is
specious and the use of the myth improper. This myth deserves no more than any other its
referential privilege:
In fact the Bororo myth which will from now on be designated by the name
reference-myth is, as I shall try to show, nothing other than a more or less forced
transformation of other myths originating either in the same society or in societies
more-or less far removed. It would therefore have been legitimate to choose as my
point of departure any representative of the group whatsoever. From this point of
view, the interest of the reference-myth does not depend on its typical character,
but rather on its irregular position in the midst of a group (10).
2) There is no unity or absolute source of the myth. The focus or the source of the myth
are always shadows and virtualities which are elusive, unactualizable, and nonexistent in the first
place. Everything begins with the structure, the configuration, the relationship. The discourse on
this acentric structure, the myth, that is, cannot itself have an absolute subject or an absolute
center. In order not to short change the form and the movement of the myth, that violence which
consists in centering a language which is describing an acentric structure must be avoided. In this
context, therefore it is necessary to forego scientific or philosophical discourse, to renounce the
episteme which absolutely requires, which is the absolute requirement that we go back to the
source, to the center, to the founding basis, to the principle, and so on. In opposition to epistémic
discourse, structural discourse on myths—mythological discourse—must itself be
mythomorphic. It must have the form of that of which it speaks. This is what Lévi-Strausssays
in The Raw and the Cooked, from which I would now like to quote a long and remarkable
passage:
In effect the study of myths poses a methodological problem by the fact that it
cannot conform to the Cartesian principle of dividing the difficulty into as many
parts as are necessary to resolve. There exists no veritable end or term to mythical
analysis, no secret unity which could be grasped at the end of the work of
decomposition. The themes duplicate themselves to infinity. When we think we
have disentangled them from each other and can hold them separate, it is only to
realize that they are joining together again, in response to the attraction of
unforeseen affinities. In consequence, the unity of the myth is only tendential and
projective; it never reflects a state or a moment of the myth. An imaginary 

phenomenon implied by the endeavor to interpret, its role is to give a synthetic
form to the myth and to impede its dissolution into the confusion of contraries. It
could therefore be said that the science or knowledge of myths is an anaclastic,
taking this ancient term in the widest sense authorized by its etymology, a science
which admits into its definition the study of the reflected rays along with that of
the broken ones. But, unlike philosophical reflection, which claims to go all the
way back to its source, the reflections in question here concern rays without any
other than a virtual focus. ... In wanting to imitate the spontaneous movement of
mythical thought, my enterprise, itself too brief and too long, has had to yield to
its demands and respect its rhythm. Thus is this book, on myths itself and in its
own way, a myth.
This statement is repeated a little farther on (20): “Since myths themselves rest on second-order
codes (the first-order codes being those in which language consists), this book thus offers the
rough draft of a third-order code, destined to insure the reciprocal possibility of translation of
several myths. This is why it would not be wrong to consider it a myth: the myth of mythology,
as it were.” It is by this absence of any real and fixed center of the mythical or mythological
discourse that the musical model chosen by Lévi-Strauss for the composition of his book is
apparently justified. The absence of a center is here the absence of a subject and the absence of
an author: “The myth and the musical work thus appear as orchestra conductors whose listeners
are the silent performers. If it be asked where the real focus of the work is to be found, it must be
replied that its determination is impossible. Music and mythology bring man face to face with
virtual objects whose shadow alone is actual.... Myths have no authors” (25).
Thus it is at this point that ethnographic bricolage deliberately assumes its mythopoetic
function. But by the same token, this function makes the philosophical or epistemological
requirement of a center appear as mythological, that is to say, as a historical illusion.
Nevertheless, even if one yields to the necessity of what Lévi-Strauss has done, one
cannot ignore its risks. If the mythological is mythomorphic, are all discourses on myths
equivalent? Shall we have to abandon any epistemological requirement which permits us to
distinguish between several qualities of discourse on the myth? A classic question, but
inevitable. We cannot reply-and I do not believe Lévi-Strauss replies to it-as long as the problem
of the relationships between the philosopheme or the theorem, on the one hand, and the mytheme
or the mythopoem(e), on the other, has not been expressly posed. This is no small problem. For
lack of expressly posing this problem, we condemn ourselves to transforming the claimed
transgression of philosophy into an unperceived fault in the interior of the philosophical field.
Empiricism would be the genus of which these faults would always be the species. Transphilosophical concepts would be transformed into philosophical naivetes. One could give many
examples to demonstrate this risk: the concepts of sign, history, truth, and so forth. What I want
to emphasize is simply that the passage beyond philosophy does not consist in turning the page
of philosophy (which usually comes down to philosophizing badly), but in continuing to read
philosophers in a certain way. The risk I am speaking of is always assumed by Lévi-Strauss and
it is the very price of his endeavor. I have said that empiricism is the matrix of all the faults
menacing a discourse which continues, as with Lévi-Strauss in particular, to elect to be scientific.
If we wanted to pose the problem of empiricism and bricolage in depth, we would probably end
up very quickly with a number of propositions absolutely contradictory in relation to the status of
discourse in structural ethnography. On the one hand, structuralism justly claims to be the 

critique of empiricism. But at the same time there is not a single book or study by Lévi-Strauss
which does not offer itself as an empirical essay which can always be completed or invalidated
by new information. The structural schemata are always proposed as hypotheses resulting from a
finite quantity of information and which are subjected to the proof of experience. Numerous texts
could be used to demonstrate this double postulation. Let us turn once again to the “Overture” of
The Raw and the Cooked, where it seems clear that if this postulation is double, it is because it is
a question here of a language on language:
Critics who might take me to task for not having begun by making an exhaustive
inventory of South American myths before analyzing them would be making a
serious mistake about the nature and the role of these documents. The totality of
the myths of a people is of the order of the discourse. Provided that this people
does not become physically or morally extinct, this totality is never closed. Such a
criticism would therefore be equivalent to reproaching a linguist with writing the
grammar of a language without having recorded the totality of the words which
have been uttered since that language came into existence and without knowing
the verbal exchanges which will take place as long as the language continues to
exist. Experience proves that an absurdly small number of sentences ... allows the
linguist to elaborate a grammar of the language he is studying. And even a partial
grammar or an outline of a grammar represents valuable acquisitions in the case
of unknown languages. Syntax does not wait until it has been possible to
enumerate a theoretically unlimited series of events before becoming manifest,
because syntax consists in the body of rules which presides over the generation of
these events. And it is precisely a syntax of South American mythology that I
wanted to outline. Should new texts appear to enrich the mythical discourse, then
this will provide an opportunity to check or modify the way in which certain
grammatical laws have been formulated, an opportunity to discard certain of them
and an opportunity to discover new ones. But in no instance can the requirement
of a total mythical discourse be raised as an objection. For we have just seen that
such a requirement has no meaning (15-16).
Totalization is therefore defined at one time as useless, at another time as impossible. This is no
doubt the result of the fact that there are two ways of conceiving the limit of totalization. And I
assert once again that these two determinations coexist implicitly in the discourses of LéviStrauss. Totalization can be judged impossible in the classical style: one then refers to the
empirical endeavor of a subject or of a finite discourse in a vain and breathless quest of an
infinite richness which it can never master. There is too much, more than one can say. But
nontotalization can also be determined in another way: not from the standpoint of the concept of
finitude as assigning us to an empirical view, but from the standpoint of the concept of freeplay.
If totalization no longer has any meaning, it is not because the infinity of a field cannot be
covered by a finite glance or a finite discourse, but because the nature of the field—that is,
language and a finite language—excludes totalization. This field is in fact that of freeplay, that is
to say, a field of infinite substitutions in the closure of a finite ensemble. This field permits these
infinite substitutions only because it is finite, that is to say, because instead of being an
inexhaustible field, as in the classical hypothesis, instead of being too large, there is something
missing from it: a center which arrests and founds the freeplay of substitutions. One could say-

rigorously using that word whose scandalous 'signification is always obliterated in French-that
this movement of the freeplay, permitted by the lack, the absence of a center or origin, is the
movement of supplementarity. One cannot determine the center, the sign which supplements9
 it,
which takes its place in its absence—because this sign adds itself, occurs in addition, over and
above, comes as a supplement.”10 The movement of signification adds something, which results
in the fact that there is always more, but this addition is a floating one because it comes to
perform a vicarious function, to supplement a lack on the part of the signified. Although LéviStrauss in his use of the word “supplementary” never emphasizes as I am doing here the two
directions of meaning which are so strangely compounded within it, it is not by chance that he
uses this word twice in his “Introduction to the Work of Marcel Mauss,”11 at the point where he
is speaking of the “superabundance of signifier, in relation to the signifieds to which this
superabundance can refer”:
In his endeavor to understand the world, man therefore always has at his
disposition a surplus of signification (which he portions out amongst things
according to the laws of symbolic thought-which it is the task of ethnologists and
linguists to study). This distribution of a supplementary allowance [ration
supplémentaire]—if it is permissible to put it that way—is absolutely necessary in
order that on the whole the available signifier and the signified it aims at may
remain in the relationship of complementarity which is the very condition of the
use of symbolic thought (xlix).
(It could no doubt be demonstrated that this ration supplémentaire of signification is the origin
of the ratio itself.) The word reappears a little farther on, after Lévi-Strauss has mentioned “this
floating signifier, which is the servitude of all finite thought”:
In other words—and taking as our guide Mauss's precept that all social
phenomena can be assimilated to language—we see in mana, Wakau, oranda and
other notions of the same type, the conscious expression of a semantic function,
whose role it is to permit symbolic thought to operate in spite of the contradiction
which is proper to it. In this way are explained the apparently insoluble
antinomies attached to this notion.... At one and the same time force and action,
quality and state, substantive and verb; abstract and concrete, omnipresent and
localized-mans is in effect all these things. But it is not precisely because it is
none of these things that mana is a simple form, or more exactly, a symbol in the
pure state, and therefore capable of becoming charged with any sort of symbolic
content whatever? In the system of symbols constituted by all cosmologies, mana
would simply be a valeur symbolique zero, that is to say, a sign marking the
necessity of a symbolic content supplementary [my italics] to that with which the
signified is already loaded, but which can take on any value required, provided
only that this value still remains part of the available reserve and is not, as
phonologists put it, a group-term.
Lévi-Strauss adds the note:

Linguists have already been led to formulate hypotheses of this type. For
example: “A zero phoneme is opposed to all the other phonemes in French in that
it entails no differential characters and no constant phonetic value. On the
contrary, the proper function of the zero phoneme is to be opposed to phoneme
absence.” (R. Jakobson and J. Lutz, “Notes on the French Phonemic Pattern,”
Word, vol. 5, no. 2 [August 1949], p. 155). Similarly, if we schematize the
conception I am proposing here, it could almost be said that the function of
notions like mana is to be opposed to the absence of signification, without
entailing by itself any particular signification (1 and note).
The superabundance of the signifier, its supplementary character, is thus the result of a
finitude, that is to say, the result of a lack which must be supplemented.
It can now be understood why the concept of freeplay is important in Lévi-Strauss. His
references to all sorts of games, notably to roulette, are very frequent, especially in his
Conversations,
12 in Race and History,
13 and in The Savage Mind. This reference to the game or
freeplay is always caught up in a tension.
It is in tension with history, first of all. This is a classical problem, objections to which
are now well worn or used up. I shall simply indicate what seems to me the formality of the
problem: by reducing history, Lévi-Strauss has treated as it deserves a concept which has always
been in complicity with a teleological and eschatological metaphysics, in other words,
paradoxically, in complicity with that philosophy of presence to which it was believed history
could be opposed. The thematic of historicity, although it seems to be a somewhat late arrival in
philosophy, has always been required by the determination of being as presence. With or without
etymology, and in spite of the classic antagonism which opposes these significations throughout
all of classical thought, it could be shown that the concept of episteme has always called forth
that of historia, if history is always the unity of a becoming, as tradition of truth or development
of science or knowledge oriented toward the appropriation of truth in presence and self-presence,
toward knowledge in consciousness-of-self. 14 History has always been conceived as the
movement of a resumption of history, a diversion between two presences. But if it is legitimate
to suspect this concept of history, there is a risk, if it is reduced without an express statement of
the problem I am indicating here, of falling back into an anhistoricism of a classical type, that is
to say, in a determinate moment of the history of metaphysics. Such is the algebraic formality of
the problem as I see it. More concretely, in the work of Lévi-Strauss it must be recognized that
the respect for structurality, for the internal originality of the structure, compels a neutralization
of time and history. For example, the appearance of a new structure, of an original system,
always comes about-and this is the very condition of its structural specificity-by a rupture with
its past, its origin, and its cause. One can therefore describe what is peculiar to the structural
organization only by not taking into account, in the very moment of this description, its past
conditions: by failing to pose the problem of the passage from one structure to another, by
putting history into parentheses. In this “structuralist” moment, the concepts of chance and
discontinuity are indispensable. And Lévi-Strauss does in fact often appeal to them as he does,
for instance, for that structure of structures, language, of which he says in the “Introduction to
the Work of Marcel Mauss” that it “could only have been born in one fell swoop”:
Whatever may have been the moment and the circumstances of its appearance in
the scale of animal life, language could only have been born in one fell swoop. 
Things could not have set about signifying progressively. Following a
transformation the study of which is not the concern of the social sciences, but
rather of biology and psychology, a crossing over came about from a stage where
nothing had a meaning to another where everything possessed it (xlvi).
This standpoint does not prevent Lévi-Strauss from recognizing the slowness, the process of
maturing, the continuous toil of factual transformations, history (for example, in Race and
History). But, in accordance with an act which was also Rousseau's and Husserl's, he must
“brush aside all the facts” at the moment when he wishes to recapture the specificity of a
structure. Like Rousseau, he must always conceive of the origin of a new structure on the model
of catastrophe—an overturning of nature in nature, a natural interruption of the natural sequence,
a brushing aside of nature.
Besides the tension of freeplay with history, there is also tension of freeplay with
presence. Freeplay is the disruption of presence. The presence of an element is always a
signifying and substitutive reference inscribed in a system of differences and the movement of a
chain. Freeplay is always an interplay of absence and presence, but if it is to be radically
conceived, freeplay must be conceived of before the alternative of presence and absence; being
must be conceived of as presence or absence beginning with the possibility of freeplay and not
the other way around. If Lévi-Strauss, better than any other, has brought to light the freeplay of
repetition and the repetition of freeplay, one no less perceives in his work a sort of ethic of
presence, an ethic of nostalgia for origins, an ethic of archaic and natural innocence, of a purity
of presence and self-presence in speech15
--an ethic, nostalgia, and even remorse which he often
presents as the motivation of the ethnological project when he moves toward archaic societies—
exemplary societies in his eyes. These texts are well known.
As a turning toward the presence, lost or impossible, of the absent origin, this structuralist
thematic of broken immediateness is thus the sad, negative, nostalgic, guilty, Rousseauist facet
of the thinking of freeplay of which the Nietzschean affirmation—the joyous affirmation of the
freeplay of the world and without truth, without origin, offered to an active interpretation—
would be the other side. This affirmation then determines the non-center otherwise than as loss
of the center. And it plays the game without security. For there is a sure freeplay: that which is
limited to the substitution of given and existing, present, pieces. In absolute chance, affirmation
also surrenders itself to genetic indetermination, to the seminal adventure of the trace.16
There are thus two interpretations of interpretation, of structure, of sign, of freeplay. The one
seeks to decipher, dreams of deciphering, a truth or an origin which is free from freeplay and
from the order of the sign, and lives like an exile the necessity of interpretation. The other, which
is no longer turned toward the origin, affirms freeplay and tries to pass beyond man and
humanism, the name man being the name of that being who, throughout the history of
metaphysics or of onto-theology—in other words, through the history of all of his history—has
dreamed of full presence, the reassuring foundation, the origin and the end of the game. The
second interpretation of interpretation, to which Nietzsche showed us the way, does not seek in
ethnography, as Lévi-Strauss wished, the “inspiration of a new humanism” (again from the
“Introduction to the Work of Marcel Mauss”).
There are more than enough indications today to suggest we might perceive that these
two interpretations of interpretation which are absolutely irreconcilable even if we live them
simultaneously and reconcile them in an obscure economy-together share the field which we call,
in such a problematic fashion, the human sciences.
For my part, although these two interpretations must acknowledge and accentuate their
différence and define their irreducibility, I do not believe that today there is any question of
choosing in the first place because here we are in a region (let's say, provisionally, a region of
historicity) where the category of choice seems particularly trivial; and in the second, because we
must first try to conceive of the common ground, and the difference of this irreducible
difference.
Here there is a sort of question, call it historical, of which we are only glimpsing
today the conception, the formation, the gestation, the labor. I employ these words, I admit, with
a glance toward the business of childbearing-but also with a glance toward those who, in a
company from which I do not exclude myself, turn their eyes away in the face of the as yet
unnameable which is proclaiming itself and which can do so, as is necessary whenever a birth is
in the offing, only under the species of the non-species, in the formless, mute, infant, and
terrifying form of monstrosity.
